<br />The Stranger in the Storm</h2>
<p>Burrowing deep into the hoods of their slickers,
the two Cub Scouts hastened along the darkening
street.</p>
<p>Stinging gusts of rain pelted their faces. The strong
wind fairly bowled them off their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say Brad, this is awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure coming down&mdash;and how!&rdquo; agreed the
older boy.</p>
<p>Brad Wilber, dark-haired and serious, was a Boy
Scout and a leader among the younger boys. An
outstanding athlete and nearly ready for high school,
he served as Den Chief of the Webster City Cubs.</p>
<p>His companion, the blue-eyed, sandy-haired Dan
Carter, had just turned ten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>Firm of muscle and old for his years, the younger
boy grew so fast it was hard to keep him in Cub
uniforms.</p>
<p>He and Brad had been good friends ever since
Sam Hatfield had organized Den 2. On this particular
evening, they had been overtaken by the storm
on their way to a Cub meeting at the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, let&rsquo;s hold up a second!&rdquo; Dan gasped as a
heavy curtain of rain veiled the sidewalk ahead.</p>
<p>The pair halted a moment under a store awning,
there to catch their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may turn to ice or sleet before the night&rsquo;s
over,&rdquo; Brad said anxiously. &ldquo;Then watch the cars
pile up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost cold enough for sleet,&rdquo; Dan agreed
with a shiver. &ldquo;The storm certainly rolled in fast.
Maybe Sam Hatfield decided to call off the Cub
meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad moved back against the building wall to
escape the awning drip. &ldquo;Not Sam,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
&ldquo;He knows the Cubs are tough. Anyway,
we&rsquo;re a little late. The others are probably at the
church now, waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From their shelter the two boys could see the
church building a half block ahead, on the opposite
side of the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>The windows on the lower floor shone dimly
through the wall of rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is lighted, so Sam must be there at
least,&rdquo; Brad commented. &ldquo;Shall we go on now? We
don&rsquo;t want to be late and hold up the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan agreed, buttoning his slicker which
had pulled apart.</p>
<p>Heads low, they bored directly into the wind.
The rain scarcely had slackened. Droplets dashed
into their eyes, completely blinding them.</p>
<p>The boys were nearly opposite the church when
Brad, who was ahead, ran full tilt into a man
huddling against a building wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the boy apologized. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see
you standing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch where you&rsquo;re going next time!&rdquo; the other
growled.</p>
<p>Because the man spoke in such a surly tone, Brad
looked him over carefully.</p>
<p>The fellow was no one he ever had seen before.
His face, beneath a snap-brim hat which dripped
rain, appeared shadowy and unfriendly. He might
have been thirty years of age, maybe older. A day-old
beard made it difficult to judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Brad apologized again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>He and Dan started on, only to be stopped in
their tracks by a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, kids,&rdquo; the stranger addressed them, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
going on over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over where?&rdquo; demanded Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that church. It&rsquo;s lighted up like a Christmas
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a Cub meeting,&rdquo; Dan explained briefly.</p>
<p>Again he and Brad tried to move away, but the
stranger more or less blocked the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub meeting?&rdquo; the man echoed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had a feeling that the stranger in asking
such a stupid question was stalling for time. He
seemed to be looking over the two boys, studying
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the younger boy program of the Boy Scouts
of America,&rdquo; Brad explained briefly. &ldquo;We have a
whale of a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the church doing all lighted up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan told you,&rdquo; Brad said patiently. &ldquo;The Cubs
are having their monthly meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His answer still did not satisfy the stranger. &ldquo;But
the church has been closed, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Brad began to edge away for he
resented the delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church was closed nearly a month while repairs
were made on the heating system,&rdquo; Dan
added. &ldquo;Now the work is finished, so services will
be held again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muttering something, the stranger turned and
slouched off in the rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer duck,&rdquo; Brad commented as he and Dan
started to cross the flooded street. &ldquo;What did he
mumble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I caught it right. I thought he said:
&lsquo;A fine thing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a screwball, Dan. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t like
his appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. His eyes were so intent they gave
me the creeps. Wonder why he was interested in
the church anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, idle curiosity, I suppose. You didn&rsquo;t know
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never clapped eyes on him before,&rdquo; Dan replied,
leaping over a river of gutter flow. &ldquo;He must
be new in Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had reached the vestibule of the church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Brad pulled open the heavy double doors and
they went in out of the rain. Shaking out their
slickers, they hung them up before entering the
main part of the church.</p>
<p>The room smelled of fresh paint and seemed
rather cold. Lights were on, however.</p>
<p>Hearing voices, Brad and Dan tramped on back
to a small meeting chamber in the rear of the building.</p>
<p>All of the Cubs had gathered there&mdash;Chips Davis,
Midge Holloway, Red Suell, Fred Hatfield, and
Babe Bunning, the youngest addition to the Den.</p>
<p>Babe, whose real name was Clarence, barely had
passed his eighth birthday.</p>
<p>Because he was the youngest Cub in the Den
the fellows made it a little tough for him, calling him
Babe Bunning instead of his real name.</p>
<p>Babe didn&rsquo;t like to be kidded, but he was game&mdash;all
the Cubs admitted that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we thought you guys weren&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo;
Chips greeted Brad and Dan. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get here
anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a raft,&rdquo; Dan bantered. &ldquo;Hit a lamppost on
Main Street and had to swim the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on!&rdquo; Chips laughed. &ldquo;I guess the storm&rsquo;s
let up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun it has,&rdquo; Dan corrected. &ldquo;Look at the
rain sluicing down those windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Hatfield, the assistant Cub leader, seemed
unconcerned about the storm. He told the boys he
had his car parked at the rear of the church. If
the rain failed to let up before the meeting ended,
he planned to take everyone home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s forget the storm and get down to
business,&rdquo; he said, calling the meeting to order.
&ldquo;We have some important matters to take up tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To stir their blood and start the session off, the
boys gave the Cub yell.</p>
<p>Like healthy young wolves, they howled in unison:
&ldquo;A-h-h-kay Iaa! W-e-e-l d-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-r
Best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s exactly what I hope we&rsquo;ll do in the
job that&rsquo;s ahead of us&mdash;our best,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield emphasized
as the room became quiet again. &ldquo;You
fellows know why I called you here tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something about the church building fund,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Midge Holloway recalled. He had heard
his father, one of the Den &ldquo;Dads&rdquo; mention the matter
at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed. &ldquo;As everyone
knows, we need a new church or, at the very least,
another wing. Now that temporary repairs have
been made, the building can be kept open another
year or so. Our crying need, though, is for a new
building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A campaign is under way to raise funds, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; Brad remarked, for Mr. Hatfield had discussed
the matter with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Brad. The church trustees have asked the
Cub Scouts to pitch in and help. What do you say,
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will we have to raise?&rdquo; Chips asked,
running a hand through his short-cropped hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No definite sum has been set. We&rsquo;ll be given a
list of prospects to see. Whatever we raise will be
that much to the good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote we do it,&rdquo; said Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Dan heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve used
the church meeting room, so it&rsquo;s only fair we help
&rsquo;em a little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Midge, Red, Babe and Fred said they were willing
to go along with the idea, even though it meant
hard work.</p>
<p>Chips gave consent by silence. Never as enthusiastic
a worker as the other Cubs, he wasn&rsquo;t too
keen over the thought of ringing doorbells.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield gave the boys instructions and
handed out pledge cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our program this month isn&rsquo;t entirely one of
hard work,&rdquo; the Cub leader then said cheerfully.
&ldquo;How many of you have read the story of King
Arthur&rsquo;s Knights of the Round Table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three hands waved in the breeze, and all faces
brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re using the King Arthur theme to dramatize
important points in a Cub crusade to &ldquo;Strengthen
the Arm of Liberty,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield went on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
make our own Round Table, armor, spears and
maybe horses for the knights to ride. How does
the idea strike you fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; shouted three of the Cubs.</p>
<p>The other boys were equally excited. Eagerly
they plied the Cub Scout leader with questions.
How would the Round Table be made? What would
they use for armor?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;It would be great if we could build a huge oak
table such as King Arthur and his knights used in
the old days. I&rsquo;m afraid it would be an ambitious
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we use an old dining-room table&mdash;one
that&rsquo;s circular?&rdquo; Brad suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had in mind. By the way, who
knows why King Arthur used a round table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, who had read the book, had an answer.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it so he could provide a place of equal
importance for every knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Dan. A round table has no foot or
head. Each knight was the equal of every other
knight. It&rsquo;s the same way here in America. One
person has the same rights as another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will we start making armor and spears?&rdquo;
asked Midge impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll gather together the articles we need and
maybe start in at our meeting next week. Mrs.
Holloway, the Den Mother, has promised to help.&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield told the Cubs they would need
cardboard, silver or gold paint, burlap and several
other items.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make banners and turn this room into a
regular King Arthur&rsquo;s Court,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The
place right now is as cold as an ancient castle!
Wonder what happened to that fire I built?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had noticed that despite jackets,
several of the Cubs were shivering.</p>
<p>A little heat was rising from the registers. But
not much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to take a look at the furnace?&rdquo; Brad
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a good idea,&rdquo; agreed the Cub leader.
&ldquo;Toss in three or four shovels of coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, Brad,&rdquo; Dan offered.</p>
<p>The two boys descended a narrow, dimly lighted
stairway to the church basement.</p>
<p>Walls were damp to the touch. In several places
water oozed in through cracks in the decaying
masonry.</p>
<p>Cobwebs hung from the overhead beams. In the
semi-darkness, Dan ran into one, cringing as it
wrapped silken threads about his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glug, glug,&rdquo; he entoned, making a strangling
sound. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being choked to death!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; Brad ordered. He reached for a
switch and the basement room became flooded with
light. &ldquo;What you trying to do? Work up a case of
nerves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan laughed and opened the iron door of the
cavernous furnace.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had built his fire well, but it needed
more fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll heave some in,&rdquo; he offered.</p>
<p>While Brad poked at the coals, Dan went to the
bin.</p>
<p>The shovel had disappeared. But after hunting
a while, he found it behind the bin door.</p>
<p>Selecting smaller lumps, Dan fed the furnace two
large shovelfuls. The coals leaped into fiery flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better give &rsquo;er a couple more for good measure,&rdquo;
Brad advised.</p>
<p>Dan trotted back to the bin. As his shovel bit
deep into the coal pile, it struck an object which
gave off a metallic sound.</p>
<p>Curious as to what it might be, the boy dug
deeper. His shovel brought to view a square metal
box approximately a foot square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers creepers!&rdquo; he whispered in awe. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
this get here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER 2</span>
<br />The Metal Box</h2>
<p>Stooping low, Dan lifted the metal box from
the shovel. It was surprisingly heavy.</p>
<p>The boy tugged at the lid, but it stubbornly resisted
his efforts.</p>
<p>From the furnace room, the waiting Brad now
called impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, slow poke! Hurry up with that coal, will
you? You&rsquo;ve been in that bin a couple of hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan emerged into the light. His hands were
smeared with coal dust. So was his blue Cub Scout
uniform. A long black smudge lay across his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what you been doing in there?&rdquo; Brad demanded,
staring at him. &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t a sight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Dan ignored the gibe. Grinning triumphantly,
he thrust the metal box into the astonished Brad&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you say?
Did I waste my time in that coal bin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad stared at the box and then shook it hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found this under the coal?&rdquo; he demanded
almost in disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You catch on fast,&rdquo; Dan grinned. &ldquo;I found it
under the coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we waiting for? Why don&rsquo;t we
open it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Dan encouraged.</p>
<p>Brad pried at the lid but could not raise it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;At least the box doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determined to open it, Brad rapped one corner
of the lid against the hard cement floor.</p>
<p>The cover flew back so suddenly that an object
tumbled out.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan stared. At their feet lay a package
of bank notes, neatly held together with a rubber
band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;Twenty dollar notes!
Must be counterfeit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, it looks genuine enough,&rdquo; Brad muttered,
equally dumbfounded. &ldquo;And look at the rest of &rsquo;em
here in the box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys counted ten stacks of paper money.
Some were in fives and tens, but a larger portion
was in twenty dollar bills with at least a few fifties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, there must be a couple thousand here,&rdquo;
Brad said, making a rough estimate. &ldquo;Maybe more.
Where&rsquo;d you say you found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan showed him the place in the coal bin. &ldquo;How
d&rsquo;you suppose it got here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know. Someone must
have hidden it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but who would leave a pile of money
kicking around loose? Anyone who would risk it
must be crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie someone hid it here in the empty
bin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bin isn&rsquo;t empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t now,&rdquo; Brad said impatiently.
&ldquo;But you remember the church has been closed.
Coal probably was loaded in here only a day or so
ago. It was heaved in through the chute and no
one saw the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory is as good as any,&rdquo; Dan admitted.
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;re rich.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Brad gave a snort of disgust. &ldquo;Rich, my eye!
You&rsquo;re not such a dum bunny as to think we can
keep this money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if no one should claim it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be claimed fast enough. In any case,
we&rsquo;re not getting ourselves mixed up in anything.
We turn this box over to Mr. Hatfield&mdash;right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dan admitted. &ldquo;I
intended to show it to him. Only I thought if no
one claimed the box, the money might go into the
Cub&rsquo;s treasury or maybe the church building
fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea,&rdquo; nodded Brad. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not
count any chickens&mdash;or rather, cash! I have a hunch
whoever planted this money here won&rsquo;t forget
about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excited over their discovery, the two boys hastily
tossed another shovelful of coal on the fire.</p>
<p>Then, carrying the precious metal box, they took
the stairway two steps at a time.</p>
<p>As they burst into the Cub meeting, Mr. Hatfield
was explaining the different types of armor used
by knights in early days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One type was made of steel mesh&rdquo;&mdash;the Cub
leader said, and his voice trailed off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse us, sir,&rdquo; Brad apologized. &ldquo;Dan found
this box in the basement. It&rsquo;s full of money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs would have suspected the two boys of
playing a practical joke. However, Brad floored them
by plumping the box itself on the table.</p>
<p>He jerked back the lid, revealing the packages
of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye gads!&rdquo; shrieked Red. &ldquo;Is it real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find it?&rdquo; demanded Midge, fingering
one of the fat packages. &ldquo;Inside the furnace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be likely with a fire going?&rdquo; Brad
demanded. &ldquo;Dan dug it out of the coal pile. Must
be a couple thousand dollars here at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s count it,&rdquo; proposed Fred Hatfield.</p>
<p>Sam, who was Fred&rsquo;s father, had not spoken.
However, very soberly he had been examining not
only the metal box, but many of the packages of
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s genuine, sir?&rdquo; Dan asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert on money,&rdquo; the Cub leader
replied. &ldquo;But this looks like straight goods to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you suppose the box came to be here
in the church?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. It bothers me though.
I must notify the pastor and the church trustees
at once. Also, the discovery should be reported
to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs wanted to see the exact spot where
Dan had found the money box. For that matter,
so did Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>They all trooped down into the basement to re-examine
the coal bin. The Cub leader could find
no clue as to the person who might have hidden
the box.</p>
<p>True, he pointed out several large-size shoeprints
visible on the dusty basement floor. But he agreed
with Dan and Brad that they likely had been made
by workmen who had repaired the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe one of the workmen hid the box!&rdquo;
Red exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield said he considered the possibility
an unlikely one. However, he would not venture
even a guess as to who might have left the box
in the coal bin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all we know, it might even be stolen money,&rdquo;
he commented.</p>
<p>Dan, who had stood near the foot of the basement
stairs, had heard an unusual sound overhead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>The Cubs became quiet. Distinctly, they could
hear a rattling noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like someone trying to raise a window,&rdquo;
Brad said. &ldquo;That box of money on the table&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield started up the stairs, but without
undue haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the wind
rattling a window. The money&rsquo;s safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite reassurance, the Cubs were uneasy as
they followed their leader up the creaking stairs.</p>
<p>If the box were gone&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield opened the door of the study. Every
eye focused upon the table.</p>
<p>The box of money was exactly where it had been
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield admitted,
chuckling at his own uneasiness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll acknowledge
that hearing the window rattle gave me a most
uncomfortable feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you suppose is here?&rdquo; Dan speculated,
fingering one of the packages. &ldquo;Shall we
count it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; the Cub leader hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too
eager to stay here in an empty church with so much
money. But then, go ahead. The job shouldn&rsquo;t take
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs seated themselves at the table. Mr.
Hatfield began to count, while the Cubs checked
his work.</p>
<p>Since the onset of colder weather, Den 2 had
made use of the church as a meeting place for
both Den and Pack gatherings.</p>
<p>In warmer weather they usually assembled at
The Cave, overlooking the river. As its name implied,
the chamber had been carved by water action,
and was reached by a flight of stairs built by
the Cubs and their fathers.</p>
<p>During the previous summer, the boys had enjoyed
many an adventure along the waterfront.
The story of their difficulties with river pirates has
been told in the Cub book entitled: &ldquo;Dan Carter
and the River Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first Cub Scout book, &ldquo;Dan Carter, Cub
Scout,&rdquo; the boys tried a little back yard camping.
Even so, they found themselves battling a flood at
a pheasant farm, and incidentally, meeting several
unpleasant persons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Now, as the Cubs watched Mr. Hatfield count
the money found in the tin box, they sensed that
once again they were on the verge of adventure.</p>
<p>The Cub leader tallied eight hundred and forty
dollars in twenty dollar denominations. Brad carefully
set this amount down.</p>
<p>Next the Cub leader started to count the ten
dollar bills. He was well into the third package,
when Dan, a little weary of watching, raised his
eyes to the window.</p>
<p>What he saw nearly caused him to rise off his chair.</p>
<p>A face was pressed against the windowpane.</p>
<p>In the fleeting instant that he saw it, Dan gained
only a vague impression of a flattened nose and intent
eyes.</p>
<p>Too startled to cry out, he kicked Brad&rsquo;s foot
under the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, cut it out!&rdquo; the older boy exclaimed. &ldquo;Be
your age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The window!&rdquo; Dan muttered. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only Brad, but Mr. Hatfield and all the Cubs
turned to see what had attracted Dan&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>But the face had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eating you, Dan?&rdquo; Brad demanded.
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve mixed up the count. Has finding this
money got you jittery?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure has,&rdquo; Dan admitted. &ldquo;But I know I didn&rsquo;t
dream up that face. I saw it plain as day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What face?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it only a minute ago at the window. Someone
was looking in here&mdash;watching us count the
money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan has got a bad case of the jitters,&rdquo; Midge
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s unexpected defender was none other than
Babe Bunning. The youngest member of Den 2
made his announcement in a shrill voice which
quavered with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the f-face too,&rdquo; he chattered. &ldquo;Only I was
so&mdash;so scared I couldn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw it too!&rdquo; Brad echoed. &ldquo;Say, this may
add up to something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield already had darted to the window.</p>
<p>The rain had nearly ceased. Gazing out into the
drenched churchyard, he could see no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn off the light a minute,&rdquo; he instructed.</p>
<p>Brad found the switch.</p>
<p>With the study dark, it was easier to distinguish
objects in the church yard. The Cubs clustered at
Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s shoulder, tense and uneasy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anyone&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield began.</p>
<p>He broke off and Dan finished the sentence.
&ldquo;Over there by the bushes, to the right of the walk!
See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone sneaking off toward the street!&rdquo; Brad
added. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s nab him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty old peeping Tom!&rdquo; yelled Chips.
&ldquo;Come on! We&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, boys!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield advised. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Usually obedient, the Cubs now were too excited
to listen.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Hatfield could stop them, they darted
through the empty church and out into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surround the bushes and close in,&rdquo; Brad instructed.</p>
<p>The Cubs circled the area where they last had
seen the mysterious prowler. Soon it was apparent,
however, that the man had eluded them.</p>
<p>He had slipped away in the brief time it had
taken them to reach the church yard. Although
they looked up and down the street, the man was
nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost him!&rdquo; Brad declared in deep disgust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. The
Cub leader, a little short of breath, had followed
the Cubs into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well?&rdquo; Brad echoed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no crime to look into the window of a
church, Brad. Didn&rsquo;t you act rather hastily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I did,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;I was so anxious
to catch that fellow I didn&rsquo;t stop to think what the
outcome might be if we did nail him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, did you recognize the person?&rdquo; the Cub
leader asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Hatfield, I didn&rsquo;t. All I saw was a face
flattened against the windowpane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, though, that he was watching us
count the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that the person&mdash;whoever he was&mdash;may
have been the one who hid the money in the
basement,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, thinking aloud. &ldquo;On
the other hand, it may have been a curious passerby
attracted by our light in the study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, we were seen counting the money,&rdquo;
Brad pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not good,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield completed,
his face troubled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have it noised around
Webster City that we&rsquo;ve found a box of money.
It might make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we should do?&rdquo; Brad asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield already had made up his mind.
He spoke decisively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most important thing now is to get the
money box to a safe place. I&rsquo;ll take it home for
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well satisfied with the decision, the Cubs
trooped back into the church to gather together
their belongings.</p>
<p>With the exception of Brad and Dan, the other
Cubs lived close by. The two boys were to ride
with Mr. Hatfield and his son Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm has let up now, so I&rsquo;ll trust the rest
of you to shift for yourselves,&rdquo; the Cub leader
said. &ldquo;Go straight to your homes and don&rsquo;t stop
along the way to pick any daisies. I&rsquo;ll report to
you in the morning as to what will be done with
the money box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; Red said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Midge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a couple of
steps. Just take good care of that money box.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, Brad and Fred will help me guard it,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind admitting I&rsquo;ll be
relieved to turn it over to someone else for safe
keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before taking the box to his parked car, the Cub
leader carefully wrapped it in his coat. Everyone
breathed a bit easier when they were out of the
church.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield locked the money box into the rear
compartment of his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, boys, just a word of caution,&rdquo;
he said as he prepared to drive away. &ldquo;Until I&rsquo;ve
had a chance to report to the police, it&rsquo;s just as
well that no one learns about the money. So I&rsquo;m
depending upon you to keep our discovery a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />Jack, the Runaway</h2>
<p>Although only a misty rain now fell, street
gutters raced with water which could not be
quickly carried off.</p>
<p>In Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s car, Fred, Dan and Brad
watched the slow-moving traffic ahead. Even taxi-cabs
crept along, wary of surface water on the
pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to see the road ahead,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
complained. &ldquo;What a night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to take Dan and me home,&rdquo;
Brad said quickly. &ldquo;We walked to the church and
we don&rsquo;t mind walking back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble,&rdquo; the Cub leader returned. He
snapped on the windshield wiper again as a few
drops of rain splattered the glass. &ldquo;Fact is, I&rsquo;m glad
to have company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield fell silent, paying close attention
to his driving. From the slight frown which settled
over his face, the three boys guessed that he was
worrying about the money box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly queer how it came to be in the
coal bin,&rdquo; Dan remarked. &ldquo;I nearly fell over when
my shovel turned it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never did finish our count of the cash,&rdquo;
Brad recalled. &ldquo;Seeing that man in the churchyard
gave us all a jolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll count the money at home,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
promised. &ldquo;Tell you the truth, I wanted to get the
box away from the church. I&rsquo;ll feel more comfortable
after it&rsquo;s turned over to someone else for
safekeeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car had halted at an intersection. As the
light turned green, Mr. Hatfield started up too
quickly and stalled the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sparkplugs must be damp,&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<p>As the Cub Scout leader ground his foot repeatedly
on the starter pedal, Dan noticed that a
car directly behind had not taken advantage of
the green light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Although the driver had ample space in which to
go around the stalled car, he did not do so.</p>
<p>Lowering the car window, he signaled for the
other automobile to pull around. Even then it did
not do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with that dumb cluck anyhow?&rdquo;
he muttered.</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Hatfield succeeded in starting the
car. Quickly he shifted gears and rolled through
the intersection an instant before the light turned
red again.</p>
<p>Dan glanced back through the rear window to
watch the other automobile. The driver had been
caught by the red light.</p>
<p>To Dan&rsquo;s astonishment, however, he ignored it,
deliberately &ldquo;crashing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That motorist is dizzy,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;First
he waits for a green light&mdash;then he goes on the
red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield turned at the next corner, heading
toward the street where Brad lived.</p>
<p>To Dan&rsquo;s surprise, the automobile directly behind
also made the turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That driver sticks to us like a burr,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose what?&rdquo; Fred demanded as Dan broke
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if maybe he&rsquo;s following us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield glanced quickly into the mirror.
At the next street, he deliberately made another
turn although it took him slightly off his route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other car&rsquo;s right behind!&rdquo; Dan announced
a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did we pick him up?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked.
&ldquo;Was he on our tail when we left the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had noticed. Dan first had observed the
car at the intersection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Note down the license number if you can,&rdquo; the
Cub leader instructed. &ldquo;The car probably isn&rsquo;t following
us&mdash;but it&rsquo;s just as well to have the license
number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys peered intently through the rear
window. The license plate number could not be
easily distinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too misty outside,&rdquo; Dan complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dropping farther back too,&rdquo; Fred observed.
&ldquo;Must have caught on that we&rsquo;re watching
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got the first two letters and number,&rdquo; Brad
said, jotting it down on a scrap of paper. &ldquo;FJ-3. I
couldn&rsquo;t make out the last number too well. I think
it was 2, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following automobile now had dropped a
considerable distance behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been our imagination,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said in relief. &ldquo;Finding that box of money and
having it in our possession, has given us all a case
of the jitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next corner, the Cub leader swung back
onto the main, well-traveled street. The other car
had disappeared from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I was wrong,&rdquo; Dan admitted. &ldquo;Either
that, or the fellow became suspicious that we were
watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we&rsquo;ve lost him,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared.
&ldquo;Hello&mdash;what&rsquo;s this up ahead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car approached a railroad underpass. In the
depressed area beneath the archway, surface water
had failed to run off. The flooded area stretched
for a considerable distance ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look very deep,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said,
weighing their chances of getting through. &ldquo;Think
we can make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, you have three good pushers,&rdquo; Brad
answered. &ldquo;Anyway, here comes another car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to try it, so I guess we can,&rdquo; added
Dan.</p>
<p>The approaching coupe, in which two persons
were visible, barely slackened pace as it came to
the area of water.</p>
<p>Noticing that the flood seemed only hub-cap
high, Mr. Hatfield likewise started through it.</p>
<p>A moment later, however, he noted that the water
rapidly was deepening on the car ahead. It began
to falter, and finally came to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stalled!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re blocked,&rdquo; added Brad. &ldquo;Think we can
back out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said grimly. &ldquo;I
should have waited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shifting into reverse, he slowly backed away from
the stalled coupe.</p>
<p>The two cars, however, had churned up high
waves. As they slapped against Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s automobile,
the engine began to sputter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; groaned Fred. &ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the motor gave a final wheeze
and died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s push!&rdquo; Brad urged, starting
to open the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield directed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
you to wreck your clothes unless it&rsquo;s absolutely
necessary. Someone may come along to help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader&rsquo;s voice trailed off, for his attention
had been drawn once more to the stalled car
ahead.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, the door on the left hand side
had swung open.</p>
<p>A boy who might have been twelve or thirteen
fairly hurled himself from the car.</p>
<p>In his haste to get away, the lad tripped and fell
flat in the muddy water which raced through the
underpass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; exclaimed Brad anxiously. &ldquo;Did he take
a tumble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was on his feet again almost in an instant.</p>
<p>To the astonishment of Mr. Hatfield and the
Cubs, he plunged off through the water, moving as
fast as he could.</p>
<p>At the same time, the right hand door of the
coupe shot open.</p>
<p>The headlights of Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s car revealed the
head and shoulders of another occupant of the
stalled coupe&mdash;a man whom the Cubs recognized
as Guy Wentworth, a referee in Juvenile Court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, come back here!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The fleeing boy paid no heed.</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth then sprang from the car and
started after the boy. Jack, however, had a good
start and the advantage of being more agile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and get me now!&rdquo; he taunted. &ldquo;See you in
Juvenile Court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the sidewalk, he waved derisively at
the referee. Then, with a scornful laugh, he turned
and darted down an alleyway between two shadowy
buildings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />High Water</h2>
<p>As Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs watched, Guy Wentworth
leaped from the stalled car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, Jack!&rdquo; he shouted after the
fleeing boy.</p>
<p>The lad, however, had disappeared.</p>
<p>Mr. Wentworth splashed through the high water
to the curb. Realizing that he could not hope to
overtake the agile boy, he entered a drugstore, evidently
to telephone police.</p>
<p>Upon his return a few minutes later, he paused
beside the Hatfield car to talk to the Cub Scout
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack Phillips, one of the boys from the Child
Study Institute, eluded me. I&rsquo;ve notified the police.
They may pick him up later tonight, but I doubt
it. Jack is as slippery as an eel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were taking him to a boys&rsquo; industrial
school?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to a private boarding home&mdash;to a woman
named Mrs. Jones,&rdquo; the social worker replied. &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
a real problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d judge so,&rdquo; commented Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s restless and unstable. Parents are dead. He&rsquo;s
been under our supervision more or less for three
years now.&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth drew a long breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a job, I&rsquo;m telling you. Jack always has
an itch to run away, and get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it he didn&rsquo;t look with favor on the idea
of being placed in a private home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack likes to fend for himself,&rdquo; the social worker
replied. &ldquo;He hates restriction. That, of course, is
what he needs and must have. I&rsquo;m afraid, despite
our efforts, he&rsquo;ll end up in an industrial school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;ll ever see him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the police will pick him up eventually,&rdquo; Mr.
Wentworth said. &ldquo;They always do. But the question
is&mdash;what to do with him when he is brought
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you think of something,&rdquo; the Cub
leader returned. &ldquo;I hate to think of a boy being sent
to an industrial school, if he has any good in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack took advantage of me, when my car stalled
in this high water. I see you&rsquo;re stuck too. Maybe I
can give you a push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Applying his shoulder, the social worker tried to
roll the car backward toward higher pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield commanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll strain yourself. I&rsquo;ll call a tow car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help push,&rdquo; Brad offered, starting to get
out into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth ordered. &ldquo;You youngsters
oughtn&rsquo;t to freeze yourselves. This water is
like ice. I&rsquo;m already soaked to the knees. Tell you
what! I&rsquo;ll go back to the drugstore and telephone
for a tow car that will push both autos on through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solution seemed the most satisfactory one.
Mr. Wentworth started back toward the drugstore.
Half way there, he paused as his ears detected the
sound of an approaching vehicle.</p>
<p>A moment later a fire engine, returning from a
run, came into view. The driver, seeing the water
ahead, pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stalled?&rdquo; he called to Mr. Wentworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hop back in your car, and we&rsquo;ll give you a
shove,&rdquo; the fireman offered.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s automobile and Sam Hatfield&rsquo;s
sedan were pushed through the water.
Neither could be started immediately. However,
after the spark plugs were dried out, both cars were
in running order once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield told the firemen.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to get home. I&rsquo;m carrying a valuable
load tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The firemen, assuming that Mr. Hatfield referred
to the carload of Cub Scouts, made a joking reply.
They told the Cub leader that the storm had been
a severe one. Several trees had blown down and
many streets were flooded.</p>
<p>Relieved to be on their way once more, Mr. Hatfield
drove directly to his residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to rid myself of this money box first of
all,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take you boys
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we stay a few minutes and help you
count it?&rdquo; Brad suggested. &ldquo;The job shouldn&rsquo;t take
long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed. &ldquo;Just
so your folks don&rsquo;t worry. Better telephone them
and explain that you&rsquo;ve been delayed a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader carried the money box into the
living room. While the boys were telephoning, he
built a fire in the grate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to count the money,&rdquo; he said when the
Cubs had returned to the living room. &ldquo;Fred, pull
the blinds. We don&rsquo;t need any spectators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred hastened to obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope no one followed us here,&rdquo; Dan said uneasily.
&ldquo;That car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we lost it before we stalled in the high
water,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reassured him. &ldquo;The chances
are we imagined we were being trailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, only I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows, just because we found a cash box is
no reason for working up a high-grade case of the
jitters,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;The important thing
is to maintain a sensible outlook. Now let&rsquo;s count
the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o,&rdquo; grinned Dan. &ldquo;Guess I did let my
imagination lead me a race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the blinds lowered, the boys opened up the
money box. The neat packages were stacked on
the dining-room table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield counted while the others watched
and wrote down the tally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand one hundred and seventy-five
dollars!&rdquo; he announced when the last bill had been
counted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! What a haul!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do with it?&rdquo; Brad asked. &ldquo;Turn
everything over to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing to do,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared.
&ldquo;I dislike to be bothered with a lot of questions
tonight though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not wait until morning before calling
police?&rdquo; Brad suggested. &ldquo;That is, if you think the
money will be safe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not worried on that score, Brad. I&rsquo;ll put
the box away and lock all the doors. Yes, I believe
I will wait until tomorrow before notifying the
police. Then they can make a thorough investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Replacing the money in the box, Mr. Hatfield
carried it upstairs. A few minutes later, he returned
empty handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you hide the cash?&rdquo; Fred asked his
father. &ldquo;Under a mattress?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A better place than that, I hope,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Hatfield. He did not reveal the hiding place.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan picked up their caps, ready to
leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield again offered to take the boys home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can walk,&rdquo; Brad said quickly as the Cub
leader searched for his car keys. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less than two
blocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Dan. &ldquo;You stay here, Mr. Hatfield,
and guard that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing that the rain had ceased, the Cub
leader allowed himself to be persuaded. However,
he accompanied the boys to the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you were the ones who found the money,
the police probably will want to question you tomorrow,&rdquo;
he warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call the police station early in the morning,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield promised. &ldquo;Meanwhile&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak to
anyone about the box or how much it contained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad were rather surprised that the Cub
leader should mention the subject twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be certain we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Brad promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; added Dan emphatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the Cubs can be trusted, I know,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
declared as he bade the pair good-bye. &ldquo;Well,
boys, I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning. Good night to you
both, and no nightmares about hidden treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER 5</span>
<br />Two Claimants</h2>
<p>Dan was midway through breakfast the next morning
when the telephone rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you answer it, please?&rdquo; his mother called
from the kitchen where she was frying ham.</p>
<p>Absently, Dan reached for the instrument which
was tucked into a shelf nook beside the breakfast
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he half-mumbled, his mouth filled with
toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Dan?&rdquo; asked a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Dan came to life then, for it was Sam Hatfield
at the other end of the line. Something must be up,
else the Cub leader wouldn&rsquo;t call him so early in
the morning! Like as not the police were wanting
to question him about the money box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, can you come over right away?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sure. That is, I guess so, unless Mom&rsquo;s got
work lined up for me. Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was certain from Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s tone that
something urgent had come up. More than ever, he
was convinced the matter concerned the money box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I am a little disturbed,&rdquo; the Cub
leader answered his question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking all the
boys to come over to my place as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money box hasn&rsquo;t been taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Nothing like that Dan. Just come over
as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely mystified, Dan bolted the remainder
of his breakfast.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later he presented himself at
the Hatfield home where Chips and Red already
had gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Dan asked the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; Chips shrugged. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield asked
us to come over right away, so we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t explained yet,&rdquo; Red added in an undertone,
&ldquo;but he seems plenty worried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>In a few minutes Babe Bunning arrived at the
house. Close upon his heels came Brad, who reported
that Midge Holloway would be a little
late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to report he has to do some work at
home,&rdquo; the Den Chief told Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on without him,&rdquo; the Cub leader said.
&ldquo;Boys, now don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I didn&rsquo;t call you
here to make accusations or scold. I&rsquo;m not blaming
anyone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo; Brad cut in anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somehow the news leaked out about us
finding the money box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then someone must have babbled!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed.
&ldquo;It sure wasn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or me,&rdquo; echoed Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how anyone would blab the
secret,&rdquo; said Brad slowly. &ldquo;Every Cub has real ideals
or he wouldn&rsquo;t be in the organization. Cubs are
Square&mdash;they keep their promises. And we all promised
not to mention the box until after you had time
to talk to the police about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed. &ldquo;You put it
well, Brad. I can&rsquo;t believe, either, that anyone would
tell&mdash;at least not intentionally.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know the information got out?&rdquo;
Dan asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a visitor. I was eating breakfast this
morning when Everett Wilson, owner of the Elite
Dry Cleaning Co., came to the door. He&rsquo;s not a
member of the church, but does attend irregularly.
Any of you fellows know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the Cubs except Babe shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him when I see him,&rdquo; Babe said. &ldquo;We
take our dry cleaning to his place. We&rsquo;re quitting
though. Last time my Dad left a pair of trousers
there, he shrunk &rsquo;em an inch and wouldn&rsquo;t make
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Mr. Wilson heard about us finding the
money box?&rdquo; Dan asked the Cub leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that. He not only heard about it,
but he&rsquo;s put in a claim for the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he happen to hide it in the coal
bin?&rdquo; Dan demanded in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I asked him. He didn&rsquo;t have a very
satisfactory answer. Furthermore, he wasn&rsquo;t able to
tell me how much he had in the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe it wasn&rsquo;t his!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that right away, Chips. I had a feeling
that perhaps he was putting in a false claim.
At any rate, I refused to turn the money over to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you called the police yet?&rdquo; Dan questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I telephoned the station immediately after
Mr. Wilson was here. A man is on his way out now.
I&rsquo;ll turn the money over when he comes, and be
glad to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure funny about Mr. Wilson claiming the
cash,&rdquo; Dan remarked. &ldquo;How could he have known
about us finding the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must have told,&rdquo; Chips replied before
the Cub leader could speak.</p>
<p>His gaze fastened hard upon Babe, who unconcernedly
was chewing a gumdrop.</p>
<p>The other Cubs looked at Babe too. He had been
in the Den only a few weeks and as yet hadn&rsquo;t been
promoted from a Bobcat to a Wolf.</p>
<p>True, he had repeated the Cub Promise: &ldquo;I promise
to do my best, to be SQUARE, and OBEY the
law of the Cub Pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, he had learned the Cub sign and the handclasp,
the salute and the Law of the Cub Pack. At
least, he had said the words correctly. But had they
really burned in?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Babe, did you tell anyone about the money
box?&rdquo; Chips demanded bluntly.</p>
<p>Babe swallowed the gumdrop and stared. &ldquo;Who,
me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you! You&rsquo;re the only one who knew Mr.
Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him. I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone!&rdquo; Babe&rsquo;s
blue eyes flashed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Chips,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. His tone
made it clear that the discussion must end. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not accusing anyone. A Cub&rsquo;s word is good enough
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that face at the window?&rdquo; Dan reminded
the group. &ldquo;Someone saw us looking at the
money. Maybe that&rsquo;s how the story got out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very possible, Dan,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s a relief to know that the Cubs all
kept their promises. If Mr. Wilson can establish his
claim, he&rsquo;s welcome to the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been dizzy to hide the box in a
coal bin,&rdquo; Brad said, getting up from the davenport.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield told the Cubs that he considered it
most important that no one reveal the exact amount
of cash that had been found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, Dan, Fred and myself are the only ones
who know the correct total,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the rest
of you have a pretty fair idea. The thing is&mdash;keep it
to yourselves. If the amount should become known,
well, it might make it easier for Mr. Wilson to prove
a claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can depend on us, Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Brad
said, speaking for the others. &ldquo;How about you,
Babe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; the youngest member of the Den returned
carelessly. &ldquo;I forget now how much it was
we counted at the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge isn&rsquo;t here, but I&rsquo;ll stop at his house and
warn him,&rdquo; Dan offered.</p>
<p>The matter of the cash box having been thoroughly
discussed, Mr. Hatfield told the boys his
real purpose in calling them was to remind them to
start working on the church building fund pledge
cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call on your prospects as soon as you can,&rdquo; he
advised. &ldquo;Today if possible. We want to get that
money rolling in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about our plans for the Crusade?&rdquo; Brad
reminded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear more about that at our next meeting,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield promised. &ldquo;Meanwhile, dig up
anything you can for costumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea&mdash;&rdquo; Dan began.</p>
<p>What it was no one learned, for just then the
front doorbell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Midge,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Or maybe the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was neither.</p>
<p>Instead, when Mr. Hatfield went to the door he
found Edgar Brakschmidt standing there, hat in
hand.</p>
<p>The Cub leader knew the man only slightly, having
seen him occasionally at church services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;you&rsquo;re Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; the
visitor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; The Cub leader moved aside so that
the man might enter. &ldquo;Come on in. We&rsquo;re having
a Cub meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to break it up,&rdquo; the visitor apologized.
&ldquo;Nevertheless, the matter I came to talk
about happens to concern the Cubs.&rdquo; Mr. Brakschmidt
laughed self-consciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t been in any mischief, I trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Nothing like that. May I speak with you
in private, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can go into the study if you like. However, if
the matter concerns the Cubs, why not tell them
about it also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;all right, I may as well come right out with
it. I lost some money recently&mdash;a rather large sum.
Information has come to me that this money contained
in a metal box, was found at the church by
one of the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were listening intently, amazed expressions
mirrored on their faces. First Mr. Wilson, and
now a second claimant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you lose, Mr. Brakschmidt?&rdquo; the
Cub leader asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rightly say. For months I had been saving
it. The amount was considerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where was this money lost, Mr. Brakschmidt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in the church. I&mdash;I went in there a few
days ago&mdash;day before yesterday to be exact&mdash;to see
the pastor. I was taking the money with me to deposit
in the bank. The minister wasn&rsquo;t there. I must
have put the box down and forgot it, because I
didn&rsquo;t discover my loss until later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Brakschmidt, I never knew you
to be so careless with money,&rdquo; remarked the
Cub leader. &ldquo;Where did you think you left the
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the seats,&rdquo; the visitor replied after a
slight hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t where we found the box!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed.
&ldquo;Dan found it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad gave him a kick in the ankle, a warning not
to tell everything he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask how you learned that the Cubs had
come upon a box of money?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the news is everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was disgusted. So were the other Cubs, who
couldn&rsquo;t imagine how the word had spread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babe, &rsquo;fess up,&rdquo; Red whispered in the younger
boy&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Did you spill it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; he retorted indignantly. &ldquo;Cross my
heart and hope to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge wouldn&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Red said. &ldquo;All the other
Cubs have given their word. It&rsquo;s mighty funny&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was speaking again. &ldquo;Since the news
is everywhere as you say, Mr. Brakschmidt, I may as
well admit that the Cubs did find a little money. We
expect to turn it over to police. If you have any
claim, you&rsquo;ll have to take it up with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still have the money here in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Cub leader admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why put me to the trouble of having to go
through the police and perhaps the courts to prove
my claim? The money is mine. If you return it to me,
I&rsquo;ll give the Cubs a suitable reward, a very generous
one in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had begun to lose patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Brakschmidt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to take the matter up with police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brakschmidt argued for a while longer. Then,
convinced that he was making no headway, he
rather angrily departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the limit!&rdquo; Fred sputtered. &ldquo;Two claimants
for the money. What did you think of him, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I barely know either Mr. Brakschmidt or Mr. Wilson,&rdquo;
his father replied. &ldquo;Obviously, both can&rsquo;t own
the money. Before the real owner of that box is
found, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in for an unpleasant time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER 6</span>
<br />A &ldquo;Tough&rdquo; Customer</h2>
<p>Dan and Brad were sorely troubled over the problem
of establishing the rightful owner of the money
box.</p>
<p>After the Cub meeting broke up they went directly
to the Holloway home.</p>
<p>Midge, a freckled-faced boy with an easy grin,
was in the back yard, helping his father stack wood
for the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure sorry I couldn&rsquo;t get over to Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s
house in time for the meeting,&rdquo; he said regretfully.
&ldquo;I promised Dad a week ago I&rsquo;d help with this job.
What came up anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two claimants have appeared for the money
box,&rdquo; Brad disclosed. &ldquo;We suspect both claims may
be fakes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The worrisome part is that the news is all over
Webster City,&rdquo; Dan added earnestly. &ldquo;Midge, you
didn&rsquo;t tell anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even my father, Dan. You may ask him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway, a Den &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; had listened closely
to the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;m confused,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this
talk about a money box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that the secret was out, Mr. Hatfield had
released the Cubs from their promise not to discuss
the matter. He had requested, however, that they
provide no information as to the amount of cash
found or the type of box.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Dan and Brad disclosed all but a few
of the vital facts. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t figure out how the story
got around so fast,&rdquo; the Den Chief ended. &ldquo;Some of
the fellows are blaming Babe, but he swears he
didn&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babe hasn&rsquo;t been in the organization long,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dependable
kid though. I&rsquo;d take his word any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Cubs didn&rsquo;t tell, it simmers down to this&mdash;&rdquo;
Dan remarked. &ldquo;It must have been that man we saw
peeking in at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>He and Brad stood around a few minutes watching
Midge stack wood. Then, aware that it was getting
on toward noon, they decided to make a call or
two on church building fund prospects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we go first?&rdquo; Dan asked, consulting a
list of names Mr. Hatfield had given him.</p>
<p>Brad studied the prospects. &ldquo;How about hitting
Atwood Merrimac?&rdquo; he proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;President of the Merrimac Bakery and one of
the richest members of our church. He usually makes
fairly large donations, but has the reputation of being
a little close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to work on him. What&rsquo;s he down on the
list for, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars. We&rsquo;ll be lucky if we get
that much. But he should come across with two or
three hundred if we put up a good argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old wreck of a heating plant ought to be
argument enough,&rdquo; Dan returned, pocketing the list.
&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get moving. We ought to make at least
one call before lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Merrimac residence was six blocks farther on,
overlooking a ravine. Massively built of stone and
brick, the dwelling was impressive both in structure
and size.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan carefully wiped mud from their
shoes before ringing the doorbell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a butler comes, don&rsquo;t let him give you that
&lsquo;Mr. Merrimac is not at home&rsquo; line,&rdquo; Dan warned.
&ldquo;Just let him know we&rsquo;re here for business and have
to see the big boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the butler doesn&rsquo;t seem to be on tap,&rdquo;
Brad declared, pushing the doorbell button
again.</p>
<p>The boys waited. After ringing repeatedly, they
were about to give up in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try just once more,&rdquo; Dan advised, as Brad started
away. &ldquo;I thought I heard footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Brad not only rang the bell, but kept
his finger for a long while on the button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to raise the dead,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it did,&rdquo; Dan chuckled. &ldquo;At any rate, someone
is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the door glass, he made out a shadowy
figure in the front hallway.</p>
<p>The man, bent and old, approached the door and
then seemed to hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him anyhow?&rdquo; Dan muttered
impatiently. &ldquo;He acts as if he&rsquo;s scared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Apparently reassured to see that the two at the
door were boys, the elderly man opened it a few
inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo; greeted Brad,
doffing his cap.</p>
<p>The old man relaxed somewhat. Though appearing
none too pleased to see visitors, he grudgingly
opened the door a little wider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t hear the bell at first,&rdquo; Dan
said pleasantly. &ldquo;Or maybe it&rsquo;s out of order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bell&rsquo;s in good order,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac muttered.
&ldquo;So are my ears. I&rsquo;d have come sooner only&mdash;one
never knows who&rsquo;s at the door. Since my butler
left a week ago, I&rsquo;ve had an unpleasant time of it.
Only the other night&mdash;but never mind. You wanted
to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here in behalf of the church building
fund,&rdquo; Brad explained. &ldquo;Your name is on our list
of prospects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems as if my name is on every list of prospects,&rdquo;
the old man retorted. &ldquo;Seems like every time
I turn around it&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Mr. Merrimac, will you contribute
five dollars for this? Mr. Merrimac, will you
donate ten dollars for that?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan exchanged an uneasy glance. Obviously,
their prospect was not in the best of moods.
It might take super salesmanship to gain his pledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we come in for a few minutes to talk about
it?&rdquo; Brad requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy this morning. With my butler gone, I
have to prepare my own lunch, and I&rsquo;m no hand
at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t take much of your time, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo;
Dan urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, come in,&rdquo; the old man consented.
&ldquo;I warn you though, you must come directly to the
point. I haven&rsquo;t felt well lately, and it makes me
nervous to hear a lot of chatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan followed their unwilling host into
the living room.</p>
<p>The evidence was overpowering that Mr. Merrimac
lived alone. Although the room was well furnished,
everything was covered with dust.</p>
<p>Newspapers had been dropped where read. Cigar
ashes littered the rugs. Blinds which were three-quarters
lowered, gave the entire room a gloomy
atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a bad scare the other night,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
said, picking up a book so that Dan could seat himself
on the sofa. &ldquo;Someone tried to break in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live here by yourself?&rdquo; Brad inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do since Hayes left me. He was my butler.
Said he could make more than I was paying. So the
ungrateful scoundrel quit on three days notice. I&rsquo;ve
been unable to find anyone to take his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had your troubles,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Maybe
you&rsquo;d rather we came back some other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we may as well get this over with,&rdquo; the old
man sighed. &ldquo;If my name is on the list, I&rsquo;ll be pestered
until I give &rsquo;em something. How much am I
down for? Ten dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad let him have it straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred, Mr. Merrimac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred!&rdquo; The elderly man&rsquo;s voice rose to
an indignant screech. &ldquo;What do they think I am?
A wealthy man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you contributed that much last year to
the Community Chest,&rdquo; Brad said, consulting a
memorandum on the back side of the pledge card.
&ldquo;The church really needs your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; added Dan. &ldquo;The heating
plant is shot and a good stiff wind might blow the
building over!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Mr. Merrimac permitted himself a tight, half-amused
smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly that bad, Dan,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit though, that we need a new church. The
cause is a worthy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how much may we put you down for?&rdquo;
Brad asked, taking out a fountain pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not prepared to make any pledge at this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Merrimac, you&rsquo;re our best prospect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to disappoint you, Brad,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
said soberly. &ldquo;I honestly do. The truth is, I&rsquo;ve had
rather distressing business losses recently. I can&rsquo;t
afford to make a pledge at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan were at a loss for an argument.
Mr. Hatfield had warned them that Mr. Merrimac
might be inclined to whittle down the five hundred
dollar pledge. But even the Cub leader had not expected
such stiff resistance as this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much have you lost?&rdquo; Dan inquired. After
speaking, he realized that the question was a very
personal one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several thousand,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac answered
shortly. &ldquo;It was stolen from my library. I kept the
money in a metal box locked in a desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A metal box!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, can you beat
that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrimac
in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have heard about the Cubs finding a
money box at the church,&rdquo; Brad replied quietly.
He was watching the elderly man very closely, wondering
whether or not he might be acting a part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs found a money box? My box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know whose box it is,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the police to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Merrimac had grown rather excited. &ldquo;If you
found a box at the church it must have been the
one that was stolen from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can prove your claim, you&rsquo;re welcome to
it,&rdquo; Brad returned, arising to leave. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair
to warn you though, that two other persons already
have said it belongs to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Merrimac pursued the boys to the door.
Eagerly he plied them for more information. Dan
and Brad, however, were in no mood to be pumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to see Mr. Hatfield or the police
about it,&rdquo; Brad told him firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of our
affair. We merely came here in the interests of the
building fund campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the building fund,&rdquo; the old man recalled.
&ldquo;Boys, if you&rsquo;ll help me recover my money,
I&rsquo;ll make it right with you. I&rsquo;ll pledge the five hundred
dollars. I might even give more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan had reached the end of their
patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo; Dan said dryly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely bidding the old man goodbye, the two
Cubs hurriedly left the house.</p>
<p>Once beyond hearing, they gave vent to their
feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three claimants now!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;This
positively is the last straw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come here to get a pledge from old Money
Bags, and what does he do?&rdquo; Brad added. &ldquo;Why, he
turns around and tries to file claim to the money
box. I give up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER 7</span>
<br />The Last Straw</h2>
<p>Discouragement weighed heavily upon Dan
and Brad as they left Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>The bakery owner had been their No. 1 prospect
and without a donation from him they knew the
Den never could make a good showing in the solicitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield gave us Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s name because
he thought we were the best collectors,&rdquo; Brad
said in disgust. &ldquo;Well, we muffed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We caught him in a bad mood,&rdquo; Dan replied,
equally sunk in gloom. &ldquo;Do you think the old cod
really lost money as he claimed? Or was it just
another trick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Search me, Dan. It&rsquo;s a cinch three persons
couldn&rsquo;t have lost that cash. The whole thing is
fantastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish we hadn&rsquo;t found that box, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. It&rsquo;s going to make a peck of trouble.
Well, what do we do now? Report to Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May as well. He ought to know about Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s
claim, even if it should prove phoney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys found the Cub leader in his front yard,
raking leaves. Leaning on his rake, he listened attentively
to their account of what had happened at
Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad break not getting the donation,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t take it too hard. Mr. Merrimac may
come through later on. As for his claim that the
money box belongs to him&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know what
to think about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just another fake claim,&rdquo; Brad declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he able to tell the amount of money in the
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was several thousand,&rdquo; Brad answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask him to be more definite or to furnish
a description of the money box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dan and I were too disgusted. We left as
quickly as we could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Merrimac probably will come to see me,&rdquo;
the Cub leader responded. Picking up a basket of
leaves, he started with it toward the street.</p>
<p>Just then a black police car pulled up at the curb.
Mr. Hatfield put down the basket and went to meet
the officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a report that you&rsquo;re holding a box of
money found by some of the Cub Scouts at a
church,&rdquo; Sergeant Billings addressed Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Come into the house and I&rsquo;ll turn
it over to you. First though, meet Dan Carter and
Brad Wilber. They&rsquo;re the ones who found the
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan did,&rdquo; Brad corrected. &ldquo;I just happened to
be around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, boys?&rdquo; Sergeant Billings said
heartily.</p>
<p>He began to pose friendly but pointed questions
which Brad and Dan answered to the best of their
abilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about finding the rightful owner of
the box,&rdquo; he reassured them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to the bottom
of it in short order. By the way, you didn&rsquo;t
happen to find a blackjack or a pair of brass knuckles
along side of the box did you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir!&rdquo; Dan returned, surprised by the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be smart to let that impression get
around,&rdquo; the sergeant chuckled. &ldquo;Catch on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if folks thought that by claiming the
box they would tangle with the law, they might not
be so quick to say it was theirs?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the Cubs to become involved any
further in this matter,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, speaking
decisively. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I called police. I want to be
rid of the box and all responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; rejoined Sergeant Billings. &ldquo;Just
lead me to the box. I can&rsquo;t guarantee though, that
you won&rsquo;t have the newspaper reporters on your
neck when this story gets out. I&rsquo;ll have to make a
report, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield admitted, leading the
way to the house. &ldquo;Well, keep the Cubs out of it as
much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the living room the Cub leader offered the
sergeant a chair and then excused himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the money box hidden upstairs,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Wait and I&rsquo;ll fetch it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was gone a long while. During his
absence, Dan and Brad told Sergeant Billings everything
they knew about the money box. They even
mentioned the mysterious face at the window, and
gave the officer the license number of the car which
they thought had followed Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s auto on
the night of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your imagination probably tricked you on that
one,&rdquo; the sergeant said, noting down the number.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll check anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, have you heard whether or not that
ward of the court, Jack Phillips ever was caught?&rdquo;
Brad inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking for him,&rdquo; the sergeant replied.
&ldquo;So far he&rsquo;s eluded us. Jack is slippery, but
we&rsquo;ll get him back in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo; Dan asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twelve&mdash;maybe a bit younger. He&rsquo;s wise,
though, in the ways of the world. We think he&rsquo;s still
around here unless he hitch-hiked to another town.
He may be hiding out in the marsh or along the
waterfront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he manage to live?&rdquo; Brad questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack&rsquo;s an old hand at getting along. The boy
has good stuff in him, but he&rsquo;s made us a lot of
trouble. He can&rsquo;t stand confinement.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>While the Cubs talked, Fred Hatfield came into
the house. He too had been calling on building fund
prospects and reported that he had obtained pledges
totaling nearly one hundred and twenty dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did better than we did,&rdquo; Brad congratulated
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just luck,&rdquo; Fred returned modestly. &ldquo;Tomorrow
I&rsquo;ll probably get a lot of turn-downs. Say, where&rsquo;s
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what were wondering,&rdquo; Dan replied,
glancing at the wall clock. Already Mr. Hatfield had
been upstairs more than ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went after the money box,&rdquo; Brad explained.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s keeping him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, Mr. Hatfield came hurriedly
down the stairway.</p>
<p>The Cubs saw at once that he did not have the
money box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred,&rdquo; his father said, pausing on the bottom
step, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t by any chance dig into the lower
drawer of my desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, father,&rdquo; his son answered in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the worst has happened. The money box
is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; Fred demanded. &ldquo;How could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t understand. Unless perhaps
your mother put it away somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield went quickly to the kitchen to talk
to his wife. However, as he had feared, she had not
removed the box from the desk drawer.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Sergeant Billings had
listened without comment. He now asked to inspect
the desk in the upstairs study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have the box in a very safe place,&rdquo;
he commented. &ldquo;Apparently, the drawer wasn&rsquo;t
even locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has no key,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield admitted. &ldquo;I thought
the box would be safe enough until I could turn it
over to police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many persons have been in the house since
you brought the box here?&rdquo; the sergeant questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, quite a few. All of the Cubs except Midge.
Then Mr. Wilson came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Brakschmidt,&rdquo; added Brad. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
go upstairs though and neither did Mr. Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one did except the members of my own
family,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said earnestly. &ldquo;I know that
neither Fred nor my wife touched the box. But what
became of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much did it contain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand, one hundred and seventy-five
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Billings whistled softly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty
stiff loss. You&rsquo;re sure the box really is lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield regarded him in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it, if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; he said
stiffly. &ldquo;Or are you implying&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks sort of funny,&rdquo; the sergeant replied.
&ldquo;You say the box has been taken, yet there&rsquo;s
no evidence anyone broke into the house. Who
knew where you hid the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed where you put it,&rdquo; interposed Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t touch the box?&rdquo; his father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume full responsibility,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said
in a harassed tone. &ldquo;I swear I thought the box would
be safe here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a report,&rdquo; Sergeant Billings broke in.
&ldquo;Likely you&rsquo;ll be called to headquarters for further
questioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you everything I know about
the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; grunted the sergeant. He arose to leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was thoroughly annoyed by the
other&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope you understand I&rsquo;m
not trying to conceal anything. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand a hundred and seventy-five dollars,&rdquo;
the sergeant repeated thoughtfully. &ldquo;A tidy
little sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not implying that I&rsquo;m trying to keep it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not up to me to figure out motives,&rdquo; Sergeant
Billings shrugged. &ldquo;I only ask questions and turn in
the reports. If I were in your shoes though, I&rsquo;d try
to produce that box. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll have to do
a little investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER 8</span>
<br />Round Table Plans</h2>
<p>Two days had elapsed.</p>
<p>The Cubs were worried and so was Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>Twice since the disappearance of the money
box, the Cub leader had been called to the police
station.</p>
<p>Each time he had been questioned politely, but
detectives made it clear they were not completely
satisfied with his answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three persons have laid claim to that money,
and one at least has come fairly close to naming the
amount you say was in the box,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield was
informed. &ldquo;Furthermore, trustees of the church feel
the cash should be turned over to them because it
was found on church property. Now you say your
home wasn&rsquo;t broken into to your knowledge, and yet
the box disappeared. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense unless
your own son or one of the Cubs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs, one and all, are honest,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
retorted firmly. &ldquo;Anyway, they knew only that I
took the box upstairs. I told no one where I hid it.
So let&rsquo;s keep them out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police had been quite decent about questioning
the boys.</p>
<p>Even so, the Cubs felt that they were involved.
Dan especially considered that by finding the box
he had brought trouble upon Mr. Hatfield and the
Den.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I have to go digging into that coal pile
anyway?&rdquo; he berated himself. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t be in
this mess except for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Dan,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield chided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
you found the box. Furthermore, we&rsquo;ll not waste
valuable time worrying about the matter. The police
are free to make any investigation they wish. We&rsquo;ll
cooperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader kept the Cubs so busy they had
little time to think much about the missing money
box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>In addition to soliciting funds for the church, they
worked almost daily on their plans for King Arthur&rsquo;s
Knights of the Round Table.</p>
<p>Den one in Webster City also would take part in
the Crusade program. At the end of the month the
two dens expected to unite their efforts for a gigantic
knighting ceremony. Prizes were to be awarded
the Den putting on the best display of talent.</p>
<p>In a determined effort to beat their rivals, the
boys of Den 2 assigned themselves a full schedule
of work.</p>
<p>Aided by their mothers, the Cubs constructed
armor of cardboard. The carefully cut pieces were
painted with aluminum, bronze and gold.</p>
<p>Red and Chips decked themselves out in mesh-type
trappings, fashioning garments of burlap which
they painted in metallic colors.</p>
<p>Next, the Cubs designed shields and mounted
cardboard spears on the ends of broomsticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have time, I&rsquo;ll make myself a cardboard
horse,&rdquo; Brad announced. &ldquo;Also, we ought to have
some painted banners to hang on the walls. Then
this place will look like a regular knight&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Temporarily, the Cubs were using the church
study as a meeting place. When the weather turned
warm again in the Spring, they planned to resume
sessions in their own quarters, the cave high over
the river.</p>
<p>Brad had made his own suit of armor by sewing
small roofing discs onto burlap. The Cubs, frankly
envious, acknowledged the job as the best turned
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make a good suit too if I had some of
those discs,&rdquo; Midge Holloway remarked. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d
you buy &rsquo;em, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. Saw a bunch of &rsquo;em lying on the
ground near a new house that&rsquo;s being built. I asked
the contractor if I could have &rsquo;em and he said I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are there any more of those discs?&rdquo; Dan
demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. I didn&rsquo;t take them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want some,&rdquo; piped up Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Chips chimed in. &ldquo;Lead us to &rsquo;em,
Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long hike from here,&rdquo; the older boy replied
dubiously. &ldquo;Fact is, to get there we&rsquo;d have to hike
a couple of miles, going and coming. It&rsquo;s right at
the edge of the marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>This information temporarily dampened the enthusiasm
of the Cubs. Then Dan spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t we go? It&rsquo;s a good day for a
hike. If we had more of those roof discs, we could
turn out armor that would look like the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we might win first prize!&rdquo; Fred said, his
interest kindling. &ldquo;What do you think about it,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it to a vote,&rdquo; his father returned. &ldquo;All
in favor of the hike, say Aye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every Cub voted to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Dan asked impatiently. &ldquo;If
we don&rsquo;t make it today, those discs may be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;Even when I was
there, not many were kicking around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s all right to take the discs?&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the contractor told me I might have all that
were lying around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassured, the Cub leader agreed with the boys
that no time should be lost in hiking to the site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have a weiner roast too,&rdquo; he proposed.
&ldquo;On the way, we&rsquo;ll pass a store and can buy anything
we want.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The Cubs quickly put away cardboard and paint.
All were dressed warmly enough for the hike except
Babe who had to be sent home for sturdy shoes and
a heavier jacket.</p>
<p>The youngster was back at the church in ten minutes,
however, his pockets bulging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what have you got?&rdquo; Chips asked him suspiciously.</p>
<p>Babe grinned and produced several crushed
cookies and an apple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your appetite,&rdquo; Chips muttered, shaking
his head. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you grow up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babe refused to take offense. &ldquo;I thought I might
get hungry on the way,&rdquo; he defended himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always hungry,&rdquo; Chips retorted. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d
spend less time feeding your face and more time
studying the rule book, maybe you&rsquo;d be promoted
to Wolf Rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Chips,&rdquo; advised Brad, who had overheard
the remark. &ldquo;Babe is catching onto Cub ways
fast. I&rsquo;ll wager he&rsquo;ll be a Wolf before another certain
Wolf I know moves on up to Bear rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s rubbing it in?&rdquo; Chips complained.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working hard and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; Brad said, giving him a friendly clap
on the back. &ldquo;Only maybe you ought to dig in a little
harder on those elective requirements before you
toss stones at anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the lateness of the season, the day was
a pleasant one. Selecting Highway 23, the Cubs, led
by Brad and Mr. Hatfield, soon set off in the direction
of the marsh.</p>
<p>Their way skirted a built-up area near the city
limits. A short distance beyond, they passed a
sparsely settled section where a few new houses
were in process of construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther?&rdquo; Babe asked, limping along
beside Brad.</p>
<p>He had attached himself like a puppy to the older
boy, but found it impossible to imitate his smooth,
easy gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there now,&rdquo; Brad encouraged him.
&ldquo;Guess you aren&rsquo;t used to hiking, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and why wouldn&rsquo;t they, with those tight
shoes? Better get yourself some that fit, Babe. The
Cubs do a lot of hiking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, when do we eat?&rdquo; demanded Red. The
brisk walk had made him very hungry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we could have the roast before we gather
discs,&rdquo; Brad said, glancing over the terrain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
for the fellows to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in favor&mdash;&rdquo; shouted Red.</p>
<p>Every Cub voted to halt then and there and build
their fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield selected a suitable place at the edge
of the marsh, not far from the road. Under his direction,
the boys cleared away dry leaves and debris
to insure that the fire could not spread.</p>
<p>While the Cubs roasted weiners on long sticks
over the coals, Mr. Hatfield again talked over plans
for the coming Round Table jamboree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pack has chosen a motto or code of honor
for this month,&rdquo; he told the boys. &ldquo;It is this: &lsquo;BE
ALWAYS READY.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready right now&mdash;for another weiner!&rdquo;
laughed Midge, reaching into the sack Mr. Hatfield
had brought along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you meant the code in a more serious
sense, didn&rsquo;t you, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Dan. Knights of old always were
ready to defend those who could not help themselves.
They were prepared to fight in the defense
of liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs can&rsquo;t fight real battles,&rdquo; protested Chips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Moral battles are very real ones,&rdquo; the Cub leader
corrected. &ldquo;We must strive always to maintain
honor&mdash;never to allow our names to be blackened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what the cops are trying to do now?&rdquo;
Chips demanded before he stopped to think how
the question might sound. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re making such a
fuss about that old money box&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad, who sat next to the boy, gave him a quick
jab in the ribs.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, however, did not take offense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you brought up the matter of the money
box, Chips,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;The police are not
trying to blacken my name. Quite the contrary.
Their job is to investigate. I have complete confidence
that they can bring to light no information
which will discredit either myself or any Cub
Scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their meal finished, the boys now cleared away
the litter. Brad and Mr. Hatfield not only stamped
out the dying coals, but for safety covered them
with loose dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice that old farmhouse,&rdquo; Dan remarked,
pointing to an unpainted, tumble-down dwelling
visible some distance away. &ldquo;Wonder if anyone lives
there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks deserted,&rdquo; Brad agreed.</p>
<p>The house was a gloomy, two-story structure with
sagging porches. Roof shingles curled and the brick
foundation had partly given away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that place has a ghost!&rdquo; Midge suggested
with a laugh. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over and find out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we came out here for roofing discs,&rdquo;
Brad reminded him. &ldquo;If we start off on a wild goose
chase&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost chase,&rdquo; Midge corrected. &ldquo;Oh, the house
can wait. But it does look interesting. After we get
the discs, let&rsquo;s find out if anyone lives there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t start
moving, we won&rsquo;t even get our discs for armor. It
will be turning dark before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Made aware that the sun fast was lowering, the
Cubs walked briskly on to the cleared area where
four new houses had been built. All were boarded
up for their interiors had not been completed. None
were occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re certain it&rsquo;s all right to take the
discs?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked Brad doubtfully. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want to get into any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contractor said I could have them all. I
only took enough for my own suit of armor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, go to it, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.
&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re gathering discs, I&rsquo;ll look at the
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discs were scattered over a large area, half
buried in the moist earth.</p>
<p>Brad helped Babe, who was less agile than his
companions. With six boys and a scarcity of metal
discs it became a race to see who would get enough
for a suit of armor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we come out short, maybe we can buy a few
at a roofing supply place,&rdquo; Dan commented. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reaching to pick it up from amid a pile of
boards and broken brick, he noticed that the cellar
door of one of the houses stood slightly ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This house is unlocked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can go through it!&rdquo; shouted Chips,
hurrying over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Brad stopped him. &ldquo;These houses are
supposed to be locked. I had permission to take
discs&mdash;not to lead a mob through any of the buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t hurt just to peek inside,&rdquo; Chips protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Before Brad could stop him, the boy shoved open
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips!&rdquo; Brad shouted furiously.</p>
<p>But the boy needed no additional warning. Already
he had been effectively halted.</p>
<p>As the door swung outward, a figure loomed up
before him.</p>
<p>Chips was so astonished at seeing anyone in the
house, he could only stare. The man was stoutish
and wore soiled, wrinkled clothes. A stubble of
beard gave his face a shadowy appearance.</p>
<p>More than anything else, Chips was made aware
of the dark eyes which seemed to bore directly into
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he mumbled, gathering
his wits. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone was in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the man demanded harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub Scout. We&rsquo;re all Cubs.&rdquo; Chips was grateful
that the other boys were behind him, gathering
closer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here picking up roof discs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, beat it!&rdquo; the man said curtly. &ldquo;You have
no business on the property. Get moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Chips or the other Cubs could make any
reply, he slammed the basement door in their faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER 9</span>
<br />A &ldquo;Deserted&rdquo; House</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you like that?&rdquo; Dan muttered as
the Cubs gathered in a group near the newly constructed
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he, Brad?&rdquo; Midge asked the Den Chief.
&ldquo;Not the contractor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never saw this fellow before&mdash;although his
voice sounded sort of familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s one of the workmen,&rdquo; Red said uneasily.
&ldquo;After all, we are on private property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had permission to come here for those discs,&rdquo;
Brad insisted. &ldquo;Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t believe that
fellow was a workman. He didn&rsquo;t talk like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or look like it either,&rdquo; added Chips. Of all the
Cubs, he was the only one who had obtained a clear
view of the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know him, did you?&rdquo; Dan inquired.</p>
<p>Chips shook his head. &ldquo;Never set eyes on him
before. You know what I think? He&rsquo;s a tramp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, he did look like one!&rdquo; Babe cried, although
he had been too far back to catch more than a
glimpse of the shadowy figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I bet a cookie he has no business being in
this house!&rdquo; Chips went on excitedly. &ldquo;The nerve of
him ordering us away! Why, he may have broken in
and be living there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without the contractor or the owner knowing
anything about it,&rdquo; agreed Dan soberly. &ldquo;Say, we
ought to tell Mr. Hatfield about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, the Cub leader joined the group.
He had been too far away to see the stranger or to
hear any of the conversation. However, from the
excited comment of the boys, he knew something
was amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What goes on?&rdquo; he asked, hurrying up.</p>
<p>Brad told him what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain the man isn&rsquo;t a workman,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;We think he must be a tramp who broke into the
house and is camping there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield noted a nearby sign which bore the
name and telephone number of the contractor who
had built the dwellings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone him as soon as we get back to
Webster City,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;These houses are
supposed to be boarded up. We have no authority
to order anyone away, so we&rsquo;ll just clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs knew that their leader&rsquo;s advice was
sound. However, they disliked to be driven away
from the premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather up your discs, fellows, and let&rsquo;s move,&rdquo;
Brad told the Cubs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the act of tying his plunder into a knapsack
made from his sweater, Dan glanced toward the
basement window of the new house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Brad!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;That guy&rsquo;s standing
there watching us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; the older boy muttered. &ldquo;Mr.
Hatfield&rsquo;s right. This is no place for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be a match for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; Brad argued. &ldquo;For all we
may know, he might be a criminal&mdash;armed. He looks
like a tough customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Face is sort of familiar too,&rdquo; Dan said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Where have I seen him before?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere that I recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him some place,&rdquo; Dan insisted, &ldquo;or at
least he&rsquo;s someone that reminds me of&mdash;I got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got what?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where we saw that fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Don&rsquo;t you recall that night of the rain
storm&mdash;on our way to the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger who asked us what was going on
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad glanced quickly toward the window. The
man however, had stepped back beyond view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He reminds me a little of that fellow, Dan,&rdquo; the
Den Chief said thoughtfully. &ldquo;All the same, I
wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the same person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they look alike,&rdquo; Dan insisted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
care much for the fellow&rsquo;s appearance when we met
him in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming boys?&rdquo; called Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>Dismissing the stranger from their minds, Brad
and Dan hastened to catch up with the other Cubs.</p>
<p>As they hiked toward the main road, Mr. Hatfield
mentioned again that he would call the contractor
as soon as he arrived at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell him that we picked up the roofing
discs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s all right, but we&rsquo;ll
double check. Then I&rsquo;ll tell him about that tramp
in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could do considerable damage,&rdquo; Red remarked.
&ldquo;Why, he might even start a fire that would
destroy the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! We haven&rsquo;t forgotten about exploring the
haunted house, have we?&rdquo; Chips suddenly demanded.</p>
<p>From the main road a weed-choked, narrow lane
led toward the unpainted house which stood on a
curving rise of land. Shutters hung at rakish angles
and the place had every appearance of being deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have time?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked, looking
at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t take more than a minute!&rdquo; Chips
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes your minutes are pretty long, Chips,&rdquo;
the Cub leader laughed.</p>
<p>The other boys also were eager to inspect the old
house, so finally Mr. Hatfield consented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This would be a spooky place at night,&rdquo; Midge
declared as they started up the lane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to
live so near the marsh. Imagine building new houses
out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land is cheap in this area,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield explained.
&ldquo;Then, Webster City is growing to the
south. In a few years, this section may be built up
solidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The land near the old house was ragged with
frosted stubble growth. Some distance away ran a
tiny creek, screened by reeds and rushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be good hunting and fishing around here,&rdquo;
Brad remarked.</p>
<p>Walking over broken, uneven ground the Cubs
approached the dilapidated house. Its windows,
streaked with dirt from the recent rain, seem to
stare at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how long this place has been deserted?&rdquo;
Dan speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hatfield,
glancing about the untidy yard. &ldquo;In fact, I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look at the old fashioned iron kettle!&rdquo; Chips
broke in without giving the Cub leader an opportunity
to complete his remark. &ldquo;And the old well
that turns on a crank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the well that turns on a crank, bright
boy!&rdquo; Red laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what I mean,&rdquo; Chips growled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the bucket is lifted. Let&rsquo;s have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; advised Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;This water
may be safe enough, but we have no way of being
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs raised and lowered the well bucket
several times, but did not drink. Dan went over to
look at the big iron kettle which in days past evidently
had been used for the boiling of apple sauce
or maple sirup.</p>
<p>To his surprise, he noted that the ashes beneath
the blackened container were faintly warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe this place isn&rsquo;t deserted after all!&rdquo;
he exclaimed in alarm. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been using this
kettle recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babe Bunning, unmindful of Dan&rsquo;s discovery,
had pulled a box to a position beneath the kitchen
window.</p>
<p>Flattening his nose against the pane, he peered
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And someone&rsquo;s been using this house!&rdquo; the boy
entoned. &ldquo;In fact, she&rsquo;s right here NOW!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER 10</span>
<br />Widow Jones</h2>
<p>In confusion, Babe backed away from the
kitchen window.</p>
<p>The other Cubs also were embarrassed, for they
had not intended to investigate an occupied dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; Babe muttered. &ldquo;Here she comes!
I&rsquo;ll bet she&rsquo;s sore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitchen door creaked open and the mysterious
&ldquo;she&rdquo; stood on the threshold regarding the boys
with curiosity rather than anger.</p>
<p>Tall and wiry, the woman appeared to be about
fifty years of age. Her iron-gray hair was combed
severely back from her ears. The gingham dress she
wore was old fashioned and faded from repeated
washing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Babe stammered, doffing his cap.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone lived here. The house
looked so old and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just passing and stopped to look at the
deep well,&rdquo; Brad interposed hastily. &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t
see one like it very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a house as run down as this,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>Plainly she had not taken offense at Babe&rsquo;s remark,
for she smiled and said: &ldquo;You boys must be
on a hike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield told her about the organization and
introduced the boys by name. In turn, the woman
said she was Mrs. Jones, a widow, and that she lived
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Mrs. Jones, you must be the one Mr.
Wentworth mentioned!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, recalling
the name. &ldquo;Do you board wards of the court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was supposed to take one&mdash;a harum-scarum lad
who has a tendency to run away,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones replied.
&ldquo;The Court promised me eight dollars a week
to look after him. I need the money. But he never
showed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he ran away again,&rdquo; Dan informed
the widow. &ldquo;Police still are looking for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not he wouldn&rsquo;t want to stay here anyway,&rdquo;
Mrs. Jones said, her gaze sweeping the untidy
yard. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to be done, and no one to
do it except me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think a sturdy boy would be a help to
you here,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;And an outdoor
life might be just what Jack needs. With a woods
and marsh nearby, he could interest himself in wild
life which he seems to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Mr. Wentworth thought,&rdquo; nodded
the widow. &ldquo;He said several city boarding places
have been tried, and each time Jack runs away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy needs strict discipline but from someone
who has an interest in his welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always liked boys&mdash;even so-called bad ones,&rdquo;
Mrs. Jones declared. &ldquo;Jack would have good food
here and a comfortable bed. The house isn&rsquo;t much,
but after all, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in it that counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow, who wore no wrap, was shivering
from cold. Aware that they were keeping her, the
Cubs started away.</p>
<p>But as they started off, Mr. Hatfield thought to
speak of the tramp who had been seen at the group
of new houses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since you live here alone, it might be well to
lock your doors at night,&rdquo; the Cub leader advised.
&ldquo;While the fellow probably is harmless, one never
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones thanked him for the warning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
as you advise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve never been afraid.
It&rsquo;s not in my blood to be afeared of anyone or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs apologized again for having trespassed
upon her property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you boys just come here whenever you
like,&rdquo; she invited cordially. &ldquo;Next time maybe I&rsquo;ll
have some cookies handy in my jar. Growing boys
always are hungry. I know, because I had three of
&rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re grown men now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lonely soul, Mrs. Jones would have chatted on
and on. The Cubs, however, already were late. So
they edged away, waved a final goodbye, and
trudged back to the main road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should cure us of peeking into windows,&rdquo;
Brad lectured Babe. &ldquo;She was mighty nice about it,
but she could have jumped all over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was I to know anyone lived there?&rdquo; Babe
defended himself. &ldquo;You thought yourself the house
was empty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Brad admitted honestly. &ldquo;Mrs. Jones
must be as poor as a church mouse. She needs that
board money badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jack needs someone like Mrs. Jones to take
an interest in him,&rdquo; added Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;She is firm
but kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine living in a place like that!&rdquo; Chips commented
with distaste. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inside is clean and not badly furnished,&rdquo;
informed the Cub leader. &ldquo;I noticed when she had
the door open. As for the outside, the windows could
be washed and the rubbish cleaned up in a few
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe that&rsquo;s a job for the Cubs!&rdquo; proposed
Brad. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to give neighborhood good
will. What better way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That yard has a lot of rubbish,&rdquo; Chips said
quickly. &ldquo;It would take more than a few hours&mdash;maybe
half a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re pretty busy soliciting for the church
campaign,&rdquo; added Red. &ldquo;Not to mention our plans
for the Round Table jamboree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a suggestion,&rdquo; Brad shrugged. &ldquo;Only
I thought the widow seems to need help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do it,&rdquo; offered Dan. &ldquo;I could spare a
Saturday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So could I,&rdquo; volunteered Fred. &ldquo;How about you,
Midge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in. While we&rsquo;re clearing away the
trash, we might find some things we could use for
knight&rsquo;s armor. I noticed a lot of old tin and metal
lying around. Also some wheels and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it Saturday then,&rdquo; proposed Brad. &ldquo;If
Red and Chips can&rsquo;t come, why that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can make it, I guess,&rdquo; Red back-tracked.</p>
<p>Chips, not to be left out on any Den affair, said
he would be on hand too.</p>
<p>The Cubs had spent more time than they had
intended exploring the countryside. With a glance
at his watch, Mr. Hatfield warned that they would
have to walk briskly if they were to reach home in
time for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can hook a ride!&rdquo; Midge suggested.
&ldquo;Here comes a truck. Let&rsquo;s signal the driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his frantic hand waving, the truck rolled
on past. However, a quarter of a mile farther on, the
hikers observed a familiar appearing station wagon
coming toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that looks like my Dad&rsquo;s car!&rdquo; exclaimed
Midge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>He was right. A moment later, with a screech of
brakes, the station wagon halted at the side of the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re going in the wrong direction!&rdquo;
Midge called to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn around,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway offered. &ldquo;I heard
you boys were out this way on a hike. The weather&rsquo;s
turning colder, so I thought you might like a lift
back into town. Of course if you prefer to walk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hoot of derision greeted this remark. The Cubs
waited until Mr. Holloway had turned the station
wagon around on the narrow road, and then piled in.</p>
<p>Midge, Dan and Mr. Hatfield sat in the front with
the Den Dad. The others crowded into the rear,
stowing their collection of roofing discs at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure swell to catch a ride,&rdquo; Dan said gratefully.
&ldquo;My dogs were beginning to ache me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the rear of the station wagon, the other Cubs
broke into song, making further conversation all but
impossible.</p>
<p>The car presently approached the outskirts of
Webster City. At the lefthand side of the road, Mr.
Holloway noticed a boy trudging wearily along the
edge of the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should give him a lift,&rdquo; he remarked,
slowing the station wagon. &ldquo;He appears tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Dan thought that the boy looked faintly familiar.
He could not place him though.</p>
<p>However, as Mr. Holloway brought the station
wagon to a standstill only a few yards away from the
pedestrian, he caught a full view of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that boy Jack!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the one who escaped from Guy Wentworth?&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield demanded incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look like him,&rdquo; the Cub leader acknowledged.
Quickly he added: &ldquo;Boys, don&rsquo;t let on that
you suspect a thing or ever have seen the lad before.
If we play our cards right, we may be able to take
him back where he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER 11</span>
<br />&ldquo;Do Your Best&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Mr. Holloway waited until the runaway boy
came alongside the station wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a lift into town?&rdquo; he called cheerfully.</p>
<p>The boy hesitated. His clothes were unpressed,
his hair uncombed. Plainly he had been sleeping
wherever he could find a bed or a haystack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; he muttered, starting to turn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, you look as if you&rsquo;re tired,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway urged. He swung open the door of the
station wagon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Jack gazed curiously at the Cubs. Apparently
however, he did not remember either Dan or Brad,
if indeed he had noticed them on the night of the
rain storm.</p>
<p>Finally, reassured by the friendly faces of the
Cubs, Jack slid into the front seat between Mr. Holloway
and Mr. Hatfield. Dan made room for him
by perching himself on the Cub leader&rsquo;s knees, his
body blocking off the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going far?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway asked the boy, as he
drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just into Webster City,&rdquo; the other replied reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to give you a lift,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said, deliberately
trying to stimulate conversation. &ldquo;Which
school do you attend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any right now,&rdquo; the boy muttered. He
squirmed uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like school, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much. I&rsquo;d rather be outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schooling though, is a mighty useful thing,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway continued. &ldquo;It helps one get a better job
and appreciate the good things of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good things of life!&rdquo; Jack repeated with a
snort. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a laugh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you&rsquo;ve had a tough time.&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway deliberately was trying to draw the boy
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t complaining,&rdquo; Jack returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
learned to get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said dryly. &ldquo;But
you don&rsquo;t seem too happy. This is the time of your
life when you should be having a good time&mdash;playing
football, ice skating, all the sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flash of interest illuminated Jack&rsquo;s face. But it
was gone in an instant, to be replaced by a look of
suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what you handing me?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And
who are all these kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub Scouts,&rdquo; explained Dan. At the other&rsquo;s blank
expression, he explained: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an organization for
boys who aren&rsquo;t quite old enough to be Boy Scouts.
We have a lot of fun while we&rsquo;re doing helpful
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our motto is: &lsquo;Always Do Your Best,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
supplied. &ldquo;Most of the boys do exactly that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds sort of sappy to me,&rdquo; Jack said with a
half-sneer. &ldquo;Who wants to go around with a halo,
always looking for good things to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than that,&rdquo; Dan defended the organization.
&ldquo;We have a lot of secret codes and things.
Right now we&rsquo;re getting ready to have a big Pack
gathering based on the Knights of the Round Table.
We&rsquo;re making coats of armor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite himself, Jack was interested. But he tried
not to show it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid stuff,&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t catch me
being a Cub Scout. Every time you turn around, I
bet someone tells you what you have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t so,&rdquo; Dan denied. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield is our
leader. Brad is the Den Chief, and I&rsquo;m the Denner.
Naturally, we make suggestions sometimes that the
other fellows carry out. But we aren&rsquo;t bossy about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs nevertheless are required to obey orders
and follow the rules,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said quietly.
&ldquo;Society is built upon regulations. Otherwise one
would have chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When one person defies or disregards rules, it
means hardship for someone else,&rdquo; added Burton
Holloway, driving home the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To heck with the rules!&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear such an attitude may bring you to serious
trouble one of these days,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway remarked
with concern. &ldquo;Better get on the beam, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I don&rsquo;t like these sweetness and light lectures,&rdquo;
Jack said, his suspicions reviving. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d
you pick me up anyhow? You ain&rsquo;t a plainclothes
detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack, we do. You&rsquo;re a runaway from the
Child Study Institute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway now felt fairly safe in revealing his
knowledge, for the station wagon approached the
Institute.</p>
<p>As he pulled alongside the gray stone building,
his young passenger recognized the familiar structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tricked me!&rdquo; he shouted furiously.</p>
<p>His elbow gouging Dan, he tried to push open
the car door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out of here!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, holding him firmly
by the arm. &ldquo;You ran away and you must be returned
here. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack fought like a wildcat for a minute or two,
but found himself quite helpless in the grip of the
two men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you gain?&rdquo; he demanded bitterly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run away again! I&rsquo;ll run away a thousand times!
You can&rsquo;t keep me. No one can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only cheating yourself,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
told him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand we&rsquo;re only trying
to help you? So is Mr. Wentworth and the other
men at the CSI. The Court is your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a laugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you keep on the way you&rsquo;ve started, you&rsquo;ll end
up in a boys&rsquo; reformatory,&rdquo; Sam Hatfield warned.
&ldquo;That, I can assure you, will be no fun. On the other
hand, if you act sensibly and make an honest effort
to cooperate, the CSI officials may give you another
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another chance for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You enjoy the outdoors, Jack. Well, I happen to
know that Guy Wentworth was taking you to the
home of a Mrs. Jones. The place isn&rsquo;t fancy and
you&rsquo;d have to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the house is at the edge of the woods, close
to the marsh. You could fish in summer time, trap
in the winter and maybe earn a little money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun they&rsquo;d let me do anything I wanted to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it could be arranged, Jack. If you&rsquo;ll give
your word to make an honest effort to get along
with Mrs. Jones, I&rsquo;ll talk to Guy Wentworth in your
behalf. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not answer for a long moment. &ldquo;Maybe
I will,&rdquo; he said reluctantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lot
to promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a promise always should be kept,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
stressed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it is with the Cubs.
Once given, a promise never may be broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a Cub,&rdquo; Jack said defiantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be a Cub, Jack. You could be anything
you set your mind to, for you&rsquo;re a smart
youngster with courage and determination. Well,
what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I have to promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go out to Widow Jones&rsquo; place if the court
elects to return you there. Just promise to do your
best, and treat her squarely. The same way she&rsquo;ll
treat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll give it a try,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;You got
me in a tight spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield corrected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
in a tight spot for many years. I don&rsquo;t want you to
feel that you&rsquo;re being pressured into anything. This
decision must be your own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I gave my promise, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Jack growled,
squirming uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course. Want me to swear on a Bible or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack. We&rsquo;ll just shake hands on that promise.
The Cub handclasp, with two fingers extended.
Here, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader demonstrated the grip used by
the other boys. Then he swung open the car door,
and motioned for Jack to step out. He made no further
effort to hold the boy.</p>
<p>Dan and the other Cubs watched anxiously, fearful
lest Jack make a bolt for freedom.</p>
<p>The boy seemed to be thinking of it, for he gazed
up and down the nearly deserted street. Then, he
drew a deep breath and faced Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two entered the Child Study Institute together.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was gone more than twenty minutes.
Eagerly the Cubs awaited his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had quite a talk with Guy Wentworth,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;At first he was inclined to give the boy the works,
but I convinced him otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will Jack be sent to Mrs. Jones&rsquo; place?&rdquo; Dan
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the plan, if she&rsquo;s still willing to take him.
Mr. Wentworth has agreed Jack may have this last
chance to settle down and make good. If he runs
away again, though, it means the state reformatory
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mrs. Jones can handle him?&rdquo; asked
Burton Holloway as he started the engine of the
station wagon. &ldquo;Jack needs a firm hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can manage him if anyone can,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied confidently. &ldquo;Furthermore, she needs
money. It will make an ideal arrangement, providing
Jack doesn&rsquo;t let us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway dropped the boys off at their various
homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home next,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Hatfield,
when all of the passengers had been disposed of except
his own son Midge, and Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can walk from Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; the latter
offered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the station wagon pulled up in front of his
home, Mr. Hatfield noted at once that a black car
with the numeral 145 stood at the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like a police car,&rdquo; Dan commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which means I&rsquo;m in for another siege of questioning,&rdquo;
the Cub leader sighed. With Dan, he
alighted from the station wagon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to cooperate,
but I&rsquo;ve already told police everything I
know about the money box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said cheerfully,
shifting gears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it get you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The station wagon drove off down the street. Dan
started to say goodbye to Mr. Hatfield. Before he
could leave however, two police officers came out
of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Captain Eggleston,&rdquo; one of the men introduced
himself. He spoke directly to the Cub leader.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to answer your questions,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied politely. &ldquo;However, it seems pointless
to keep going over the same ground. I&rsquo;ve told everything
I know about the missing money box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have a few questions to ask,&rdquo; Captain
Eggleston replied. &ldquo;In fact, we have some new evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we talk to you inside the house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded Mr. Hatfield, somewhat
puzzled by the serious attitude of the police.</p>
<p>As he started to accompany the two men, Dan
turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the boy who found the box at the
church?&rdquo; Captain Eggleston asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may as well stick around,&rdquo; the captain
advised. &ldquo;We may have a few questions to fire at
you too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER 12</span>
<br />A Pair of Legs</h2>
<p>Feeling almost as if he were a suspect in a crime
case, Dan followed Mr. Hatfield and the two police
officers into the house.</p>
<p>Captain Eggleston began the interview by asking
routine questions of both Dan and Mr. Hatfield.
Then abruptly he announced that a check had been
made of the car license number noted down by the
Cubs on the night of the heavy rain storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The automobile belongs to Frank Jankowski, a
salesman for the V. H. Everetts Hardware Co.,&rdquo; he
informed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jankowski!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, the boys were mistaken in thinking
that the car was following us,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.
&ldquo;Imagination plays strange tricks on the mind. I
thought myself&mdash;at least for a while&mdash;that we were
being followed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given us several false steers in this investigation,&rdquo;
Captain Eggleston said rather severely.
&ldquo;What are you trying to hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question irritated Mr. Hatfield. He tried not
to show resentment and kept his voice controlled as
he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you placed the money box in the drawer
of your desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You considered it a safe place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough. If I hadn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d have made other
disposition of the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you delay in calling police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone over all that before,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said wearily. &ldquo;It was late, and frankly, I was tired.
I didn&rsquo;t feel equal to a long harangue with police
until I was more rested. So I waited until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first discovery that the box was gone was
when police arrived here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to your knowledge, no one entered or left
the house in the meantime?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My wife was here, of course. I don&rsquo;t recall anyone
else, unless one of the Cubs dropped in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I know.&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield was amazed
by the question. He could tell that Captain Eggleston
was leading up to a climax, but what it was he
could not guess.</p>
<p>The police officer withdrew an ornamental button
from his pocket. Carelessly, he dropped it on the
table.</p>
<p>Dan noticed that the button was an unusual one
of black jet, cut in a diamond shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see that before?&rdquo; Captain Eggleston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied, examining
the button minutely. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife allowed us to examine the study again.
We found this button in the drawer where she said
you had kept the tin box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a button from a woman&rsquo;s dress. But
I don&rsquo;t recall that my wife has one with jet fasteners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she said.&rdquo; Captain Eggleston picked up the
button and dropped it into his pocket again. &ldquo;The
button may or may not be a clue. It&rsquo;s not much to
go on in any case.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think the box may have been taken by a
woman?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This button is the only thing that points in that
direction. It may have been in the drawer for a long
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw it before. At least I never noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policemen at last seemed to accept Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s
word that he had told them everything he
knew about the disappearance. They asked Dan a
few routine questions and finally left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be jogging along too,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
get a move on, I&rsquo;ll be late for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your roofing discs,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reminded
him. &ldquo;See you tomorrow. Meanwhile, don&rsquo;t
worry about the money. Sooner or later, police will
turn up a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his way to the door, Dan asked the Cub leader
if he thought the jet button had any real significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it myself,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied.
&ldquo;Though how the button came to be in the desk is
a puzzle too. This whole thing is a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault for finding the box in the first
place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield laughed and clapped Dan on the
back. &ldquo;Now, none of that talk, Dan!&rdquo; he chided.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the thing straightened out. Forget about
it and let me do the worrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the Cub leader&rsquo;s admonition, Dan could
not drive thoughts of the tin box from his mind.</p>
<p>That night, from his father, he learned that it was
generally known in Webster City that the Cubs had
found the box. Furthermore, a number of thoughtless
persons were criticizing Mr. Hatfield for not
having taken better care of the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awkward that several people have put in a
claim to the cash,&rdquo; his father added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least two of &rsquo;em must be fake claims,
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d judge so,&rdquo; agreed his father. &ldquo;But to prove it
may not be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day, the Cubs met briefly at the
church to compare notes on how they were making
their suits of armor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hatfield and Mrs. Holloway both were there
to help the boys with the work. Brad was the only
one who had finished his suit. In a burst of enthusiasm
he had gone ahead, making a cardboard horse
which could be worn over his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have the best Round Table of any
of the Dens,&rdquo; Dan declared, his enthusiasm at high
pitch.</p>
<p>At that moment Babe uttered a loud wail. In the
act of painting a coat of arms on a banner, he had
upset a can of red paint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dope!&rdquo; Chips scolded the younger boy. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you watch what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Babe mumbled. &ldquo;I accidentally kicked
the can with my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look what you&rsquo;ve done to the carpet. The
church will be making us pay for it! The trustees
will say the Cubs are just a bunch of careless babies
who destroy property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am not</i> a baby,&rdquo; the younger boy said furiously.
&ldquo;It was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Hatfield. &ldquo;One
we&rsquo;re quite prepared for too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Cubs watched in admiration, she wiped
up the paint, and cleaned the carpet with turpentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, every trace is gone,&rdquo; she assured the
crestfallen Babe. &ldquo;Chips, a knight should practice
chivalry, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means being polite and courteous to others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Babe was awkward,&rdquo; said Chips angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we all at times, Chips. Speaking of a
Knight&rsquo;s code of honor, our Den should have one.
Any suggestions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already have one rule,&rdquo; Dan recalled. &ldquo;Be
Always Ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work out some others,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Hatfield.
&ldquo;Everyone think hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away from deep water!&rdquo; Red offered
eagerly.</p>
<p>Several of the Cubs snickered. Mrs. Hatfield,
however, nodded her head approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent safety rule, Red. I think, though,
we may find others which fit in a little better with
knighthood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knights did a lot of fighting,&rdquo; Midge said reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which leads us to this thought,&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
Hatfield. &ldquo;Be prepared always to fight in defense of
right, or your own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about doing good for others?&rdquo; proposed
Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent. Now we have three rules for our
knights to follow: &lsquo;Be Always Ready. Be Prepared.
And Do Good Unto Others.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re easy rules to remember,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;But
to follow &rsquo;em may not be quite so simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs worked a while longer on their armor.
As they began to grow tired, Mrs. Hatfield said it
was time to break up the meeting. Before the Cubs
left the church, she reminded them to keep working
on their pledge list for the building fund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money isn&rsquo;t coming in as fast as we&rsquo;d like,&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re especially short from the persons
we expected to give fairly large amounts. So
during the next few days dig in and really do your
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad were the last to leave, lingering
behind to help Mrs. Hatfield and Mrs. Holloway
clean up the litter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you meant us, Mrs. Hatfield,&rdquo; Brad remarked
as they closed the church doors. &ldquo;Dan and
I haven&rsquo;t been very lucky in signing up our best
prospects. Especially Mr. Merrimac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve worked hard I know,&rdquo; she praised him.
&ldquo;All the same, it might be worth while to call on
Mr. Merrimac again. He might change his mind if
you use your best powers of persuasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that, knowing him,&rdquo; Brad replied gloomily.
&ldquo;We can try though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>After leaving Mrs. Hatfield, the two boys walked
on to the Merrimac home. Neither of them had any
enthusiasm for the interview ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get it over with,&rdquo; Brad sighed, as he
shoved hard on the doorbell. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do any worse
than turn us down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Merrimac kept the boys waiting. Repeatedly,
Brad jabbed his finger on the doorbell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; Dan insisted. &ldquo;I can hear him
moving around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not he&rsquo;s seen us from a window and is
hiding out,&rdquo; Brad returned in disgust. &ldquo;Merrimac is
playing hard to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annoyed because the elderly gentleman refused
to come to the door, he punched the doorbell two
or three times in rapid succession and then gave
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me sick,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Mr. Merrimac
at least ought to see us. That&rsquo;s only common courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In leaving the premises, the boys walked around
toward the rear of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the kitchen window is wide open!&rdquo; Dan
observed in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Mr. Merrimac, they both knew, was no fresh air
fiend. Furthermore, the weather was far too cold
for one comfortably to keep a window wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; Brad said, stopping short. &ldquo;S-a-y!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two Cubs stared in utter amazement, a
pair of legs protruded from the window.</p>
<p>Before either Dan or Brad could recover from
astonishment, a man leaped lightly to the ground.
Seeing the two boys, he ducked his head and ran
toward the alley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER 13</span>
<br />Hot Biscuits</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, a thief!&rdquo; cried Brad, the first to recover
from shock. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been rifling Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one accord, he and Dan gave chase to the
intruder.</p>
<p>From the start it was a losing race. The man
already had put a considerable distance between
himself and the Merrimac house.</p>
<p>Long-legged and surprisingly agile for his weight,
he continued to gain on Dan and Brad.</p>
<p>Finally, he slipped between two buildings and
was completely lost. Winded, the boys halted to
consider what next to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance to catch him now,&rdquo; Brad puffed.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call the police, and then go back to Merrimac&rsquo;s
place. He may have slugged that old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, didn&rsquo;t you think that fellow looked like the
tramp we saw out near the marsh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he had the same general build, Dan. I
didn&rsquo;t see his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I. He purposely kept his hat pulled
low over his eyes. Heck, just our luck to let him get
away! For all we know, he might even be the one
who stole the money box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;Our best bet is
to put police on his trail. If we can furnish a good
description, they may be able to pick him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Circling the block to make certain the intruder
had not emerged elsewhere in the vicinity, the boys
sought a policeman. Unable to find one in the neighborhood,
they telephoned their report to the Central
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; Brad said in relief. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s
hustle back to Merrimac&rsquo;s place and find out if the
old man&rsquo;s been hurt. I&rsquo;ve got a mighty uneasy feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Merrimac home a few minutes
later, the boys saw that the kitchen window remained
wide open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Raise me up and I&rsquo;ll look in,&rdquo; Dan proposed.</p>
<p>Brad lifted him so that he could grab the sill and
partly support his own weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one on the floor. But I can only see
the kitchen. Think I should crawl on in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was given no opportunity to decide, for just
then a hand was laid heavily upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>Startled, he whirled around so suddenly, that his
supporting shoulder deprived Dan of a substantial
base. The younger boy lost his balance and slipped
to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here? Trying to break in, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad found themselves confronted by
Atwood Merrimac. A sack of groceries clutched in
one hand, he held Brad with the other as he gazed
sternly at the two Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo; Brad murmured in
relief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to see you&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine you&rsquo;re glad to see me! Sort of
caught you in the act, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan were aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;you can&rsquo;t think we were trying
to break in!&rdquo; the latter gasped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless appearances are deceitful, you gave a
first class imitation of it, my lad! How did that window
get open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their anxiety to clear themselves, both boys
talked at once.</p>
<p>Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s wrinkled face softened as he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you thought I might have been laid out,&rdquo; he
declared in satisfaction. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anyone had
that much interest in my welfare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as the full implication of the open window
came to him, he added anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This makes the second time my house has been
entered! I wonder what&rsquo;s missing this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handing the sack of groceries to Brad, the elderly
man unlocked the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; he invited, as the boys hesitated.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing appeared to have been disturbed in the
kitchen. The room however, was in a frightful state
of disorder. Mr. Merrimac had not washed the
breakfast dishes, and the remains of a meager lunch
remained on the white porcelain table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to clean up yet today,&rdquo; he
apologized. &ldquo;Living alone makes one fall into careless
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>With the boys close at his heels, Mr. Merrimac
went from room to room. In none was there any evidence
that anything had been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is exactly as I left it a half hour ago
when I went to the grocery store,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
said in a puzzled tone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you saw that fellow
crawling out of the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We not only saw him, we chased him down the
alley,&rdquo; Dan said earnestly. &ldquo;You believe us, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m not doubting your word. Only it
seems strange. Twice in a week my house has been
entered. This time you must have driven the thief
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably what happened,&rdquo; Brad agreed.
&ldquo;I certainly rang the doorbell hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your place was entered that other
time&mdash;you really lost money?&rdquo; Dan asked hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I did. More than two thousand dollars.
I kept it in a tin box in a drawer of the dining room
buffet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan were convinced that the money
they had found in the church must belong to Mr.
Merrimac rather than to the other claimants. But if
such were the case, how could the box ever have
been transferred to the church basement? And what
had become of it since then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be receiving a call from the police any
minute,&rdquo; Dan warned the old man. &ldquo;We called them
and reported the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat it, what did you do that for?&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
exploded. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I enough trouble without being
pestered by officers who&rsquo;ll ask me a hundred questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Dan apologized. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know
that nothing had been taken. We weren&rsquo;t even sure
that you might not have been slugged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so testy,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
said. &ldquo;You did the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad decided that nothing could be
gained at the moment by speaking to the old man
about the church building pledge. It would be far
wiser, they thought, to bring up the matter at another
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back whenever you feel like it,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
invited the Cubs as he escorted them to the
front door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thanks, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo; Dan returned,
startled by the elderly man&rsquo;s cordiality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Later on, we&rsquo;ll talk about the church building
fund,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac added, apparently guessing
why the boys had come. &ldquo;Losing all that money upset
me. If I get it back, I&rsquo;ll not forget you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this promise, Dan and Brad had to content
themselves.</p>
<p>All week the Cubs worked on their armor and
made preparation for the scheduled Round Table
gathering. So enthusiastic were all the Cubs, that it
had been decided, not only Den 2, but the entire
Pack comprised of three Webster City dens, would
take part.</p>
<p>Nearly every morning before school, Dan was up
early making articles which could be used at the
grand knighting ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you painting and making designs,&rdquo;
his mother praised his work. &ldquo;I wish though, you&rsquo;d
conduct your creative experiments outdoors. Fresh
paint doesn&rsquo;t go well with the pattern of the kitchen
linoleum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan took the hint and used the back porch for his
work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>One morning while the dew was still heavy on the
ground, he was painting a triangular banner to hang
on the back of a ceremonial chair. Dan brushed on
two red diamonds and then experimented with a few
bright blue &ldquo;X&rdquo; marks sprinkled at random over the
surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard at work?&rdquo; inquired a friendly voice.</p>
<p>Dan glanced up to see the milkman looking over
his shoulder. He had not heard the wagon drive
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan grinned, moving aside so the man
could reach the milk box at the doorstep. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
ready for the big Cub Scout knighting ceremony
we&rsquo;re to have at the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs really do a lot of interesting things,&rdquo;
replied the milkman. He slipped two bottles into
the box and gathered up the empties. &ldquo;I read the
other day how the Cubs found some money&mdash;say,
weren&rsquo;t you the one who turned up that tin box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; agreed Dan. &ldquo;I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t
found it too! So many persons have put in a claim.
Then to make matters worse, the box disappeared
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read about that too. Some neighbors of Mr.
Hatfield told me the police gave him a pretty rough
going over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They questioned him, the same as they did me,&rdquo;
Dan replied indignantly. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s routine. He
doesn&rsquo;t know what became of the money. Someone
swiped it from his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was the box supposed to have disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows. We took it there the night it was
found in the church. Then the next morning when
the police came, Mr. Hatfield couldn&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve been wondering if I should report
this,&rdquo; the milkman said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Report what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anything about it until after I&rsquo;d
read about the box disappearing, Dan. Then I began
to wonder. I was delivering milk to the house across
the street from the Hatfield place. It must have been
about six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; Dan asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman came out of the cellar exit. She seemed
to be quite an old lady in a black dress and a shawl
of the same color. I couldn&rsquo;t see her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hatfield never dresses like that. She has
modern clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman had a bundle under her arm. The
object, whatever it was, had been wrapped in a
newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day was this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the date. It was the same morning
Mr. Hatfield reported he lost the money. I&rsquo;d
have told him about it, only it didn&rsquo;t register on me
until yesterday that there might be any connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I know no one lives at the Hatfield
house except Sam, his wife, and Fred,&rdquo; Dan said,
deeply puzzled. &ldquo;Who could the old lady have
been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no one I knew. She kept the shawl over
her head, either to hide her face or protect it from
the cold air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did she go?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice. As I say, at the time I thought
nothing about seeing her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Hatfield should know about this, and
maybe the police,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;So far, the only clue
found is a black jet button. Apparently, it came
from a woman&rsquo;s dress. But how could a woman have
known about the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The milkman did not try to answer. Already late
on his route, he started toward his wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get a chance to talk to Mr. Hatfield until
late tonight,&rdquo; he called over his shoulder. &ldquo;If you
think what I told you means anything, Dan, let him
know for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it right away,&rdquo; the boy promised.</p>
<p>Even before the milk wagon was out of sight, he
had gathered up his materials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, how about rushing breakfast?&rdquo; he asked,
carrying both the milk and his work into the kitchen.
&ldquo;I want to see Mr. Hatfield before I go to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set the food right on,&rdquo; his mother promised.</p>
<p>Dan ate on the fly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for me after school
tonight,&rdquo; he advised as he banged out the door. &ldquo;The
Cubs are having a cook-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Hatfield home, Dan found the Cub leader,
his wife, and Fred eating their own breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a roll and some chocolate with us,&rdquo; Mrs.
Hatfield invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my breakfast,&rdquo; Dan replied, eyeing the
sugary hot roll with a greedy eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a growing boy always can eat a little more,&rdquo;
Mrs. Hatfield laughed, offering him a chair. &ldquo;Do
have something with us, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the boy slid into the seat by the window.
As he sipped hot chocolate, he told Mr. Hatfield
what the milkman had reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An elderly woman in black!&rdquo; Mrs. Hatfield exclaimed.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had no cleaning woman?&rdquo; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in weeks, Dan. And no visitors at such an
early hour of the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I locked all the doors that night we brought the
box here,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one opening into the cellar?&rdquo; his wife asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Hatfield said.
&ldquo;Oh, Sam, you <i>were</i> careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; the Cub leader admitted. &ldquo;After
all the preaching I&rsquo;ve done to the Cubs too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; Dan said loyally. &ldquo;Until
lately, it&rsquo;s never been necessary to lock a house up
tight to keep one&rsquo;s belongings safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This always has been a good neighborhood,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield agreed. &ldquo;That fact gave me a false sense of
security, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the milkman saw a woman leaving the house,
that&rsquo;s obviously where the money box went,&rdquo; Mrs.
Hatfield declared, refilling Dan&rsquo;s cup with chocolate.
&ldquo;It explains too why the police found a jet button
near where the box had been hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But who could the woman have been?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
murmured. &ldquo;So far as we know, the only person
besides the Cubs who knew about the box was that
man caught peeping into the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have told others,&rdquo; Mrs. Hatfield
reasoned. &ldquo;We can be fairly certain of that because
so many claims were put in for the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning about this woman convinces me of one
thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive none of the
Cubs told about the box. The leak came from another
source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell police?&rdquo; Dan questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dan. This clue may be the most important
one yet. I&rsquo;ve begun to think though, that the money
never will be recovered. In that case, if the rightful
claimant can prove his assertion, I&rsquo;ll make good the
loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem fair, Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Dan protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assumed responsibility for the money, Dan.
Seemingly it was lost through my carelessness. I
couldn&rsquo;t face the Cubs if I didn&rsquo;t make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan said no more. He knew that Mr. Hatfield,
being a man of honor, would keep his word. However,
he realized also that the Hatfields were only
moderately well fixed and could not afford to lose
so much of their savings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t worry about it, Dan,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said as they all arose from the breakfast table.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking this matter entirely too seriously.
Everything will come out in the wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the money isn&rsquo;t found, we&rsquo;ll give up that new
car we had intended to buy,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Hatfield.
&ldquo;Expensive automobiles are an unnecessary luxury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan looked so troubled that Mr. Hatfield, to take
his mind off the money box, said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set for the cook-out tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remind all the Cubs to meet here at my house
right after school. Now you and Fred had better get
along to school, or you&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan thanked the Hatfields for the breakfast, and
gathering up his books, went off with Fred.</p>
<p>Later, after school had been dismissed for the
day, all the Cubs met at Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s home for the
hike and cook-out.</p>
<p>No more was said about the missing tin box, for
the Cub leader felt that the matter had been too
much discussed. He preferred to have the boys center
thoughts on the Knight Crusade and their own
activities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Dan fell into step with Brad as they
set off for the marsh area, again bringing up the recent
incident at Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s home. So far as
either boy knew, police had not been able to catch
the man who had fled from the dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, do you suppose there could be any connection
between that thief and the woman who took the
tin box?&rdquo; Dan speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; Brad returned, shifting his knapsack
to the other shoulder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget the money for
tonight and just have fun. Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s worried
enough without us always reminding him of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dan agreed, properly set down.
&ldquo;Guess I have had it on my mind a lot lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys hiked to an old mill of historical interest.
After spending a while there, they back-tracked to
the marshland area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that old tramp is still camped out in
the new house?&rdquo; Dan speculated as they passed the
construction site.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield heard the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer that one,&rdquo; he informed the group.
&ldquo;I talked to Mr. Keeler, the contractor. He checked
and found you boys were right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the man was a tramp?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had managed to get in through a cellar
window, and then had unlocked the door from inside.
Until he was caught, he enjoyed quite a comfortable
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrested?&rdquo; Brad questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he slipped away before Mr. Keeler could
call police. I understand no damage was done to the
property. He easily could have set the place on fire
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, when do we eat?&rdquo; demanded Midge, impatiently.
&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s getting low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can stop anywhere,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;Look
for a suitable place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the one we used last time?&rdquo; suggested
Chips. &ldquo;It will save us clearing the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Cubs shared Chip&rsquo;s impatience, so a
little farther on, a halt was called. While Brad and
Dan built a fire, Mr. Hatfield set up a reflector oven
which he had made from a square five-gallon oil can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty fancy, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Red said admiringly.
&ldquo;What are we eating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biscuits, fried eggs and bacon. How does it
sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; Red answered, smacking his lips. &ldquo;Just
lead me to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lead you to it, like fun!&rdquo; snorted Brad. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
gonna help stir up the biscuits, not have &rsquo;em served
to you golden brown on a tin plate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Make biscuits? I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can learn,&rdquo; the Den Chief assured him.
&ldquo;Nothing to it when you use biscuit mix. You just
add water and stir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the other Cubs gathered wood, he showed
Red how to mix the biscuits and drop them evenly
on a metal sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each Cub can cook his own bacon and eggs,&rdquo;
Brad said, producing a sheet of tinfoil. &ldquo;Shape &rsquo;em
into little pans, and fry the bacon just enough to
make a little grease. Then drop in the eggs. You can
use the crinkled foil for a plate too, and not have to
wash a dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a brain! What a brain!&rdquo; This praise came
from Midge, who above everything else hated to
wash dishes.</p>
<p>Soon the wood had burned down to coals. As the
reflector oven heated up, Mr. Hatfield tested it, and
told Red he could put in the biscuits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long now, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re
waiting for the biscuits to bake, I wish a couple of
you would go for some more water. Try that first
house down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Rather than stand around, all the boys except Red
took their canteens and trudged off. The latter remained
with Mr. Hatfield to keep an eye on the biscuits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rising just right,&rdquo; the Cub leader said,
presently peeking into the oven. &ldquo;Another five minutes
and they&rsquo;ll be golden brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure smell good,&rdquo; Red declared, sniffing
the air. &ldquo;I could eat a dozen of &rsquo;em myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only allowed three for each Cub,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
laughed. &ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s burning out though. We
need more wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs had not gathered enough. So after taking
another glance at the biscuits to be certain they
would not burn, Mr. Hatfield and Red set off together
to find a few sticks.</p>
<p>Suitable wood was not to be found close to the
camp. Already the Cubs had gathered this. Compelled
to seek farther away, the Cub leader and Red
consumed more time than they had intended in
gathering sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield advised. &ldquo;If we let
those biscuits burn, the boys will mob us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two returned to the campfire, they met the
Cubs trotting in with their filled canteens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; yelled Dan. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t those biscuits done
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should be,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield answered. &ldquo;Start
your eggs frying, boys, so everything will come off
the fire at the same time. Brad will show you what
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about those biscuits?&rdquo; Red said anxiously.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been in the oven a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too long,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;We want
&rsquo;em a nice deep brown. But I&rsquo;ll take a quick look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager for a peek themselves, the Cubs gathered
around.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield opened the oven. A blast of heat
struck the Cubs full in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what happened to &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Dan demanded in
astonishment. &ldquo;Where are those wonderful biscuits
you were bragging about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oven was empty. Gone were the biscuits and
likewise the metal sheet upon which they had been
baked!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER 14</span>
<br />Beside the Camp Fire</h2>
<p>The Cubs stared at the empty oven, uncertain
whether or not Mr. Hatfield and Red had played a
trick upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where are they?&rdquo; Midge demanded. &ldquo;Who
swiped the biscuits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>His grim tone left no doubt that the biscuits
actually were missing. Their disappearance was as
mysterious to Mr. Hatfield and Red as to the other
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they were here a few minutes ago!&rdquo; Red
exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s swiped &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield glanced quickly about the camp. No
one however, was within sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the dirty tricks!&rdquo; Dan exploded. &ldquo;Taking
the food right out of our mouths!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the bacon and eggs?&rdquo; Fred demanded.
&ldquo;Have they walked off too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A check disclosed that the other food remained
untouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and fry your bacon and eggs,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
advised. &ldquo;Brad and I will take a quick look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair circled the camp, even venturing a short
distance into the woods. Because the ground was
firm and dry, they could find no telltale footprints.
Nor did they see anyone.</p>
<p>Giving up the search, they returned a few minutes
later to share bacon and eggs with the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This supper is ruined without the biscuits,&rdquo; Red
complained. &ldquo;I made &rsquo;em super! Honestly, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they turned out so hard you were afraid
to serve &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Babe joked. &ldquo;So to fool us, you buried
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so,&rdquo; Red denied hotly. &ldquo;The biscuits
were perfect when Mr. Hatfield and I went to gather
wood. Someone stole &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been that tramp who hid out in the
house,&rdquo; Brad said thoughtfully. &ldquo;For all we know, he
may still be around somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait until I meet him again!&rdquo; Midge declared,
scraping the last bit of egg from his tinfoil
cup plate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a piece of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the tramp,&rdquo; speculated Chips.
He poked the coals with a stick, and having stirred
the flames, tossed a crumpled ball of foil to the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could it have been?&rdquo; demanded Fred.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen no one on this road. Only cars that whiz
past at twenty-five miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips had fastened his gaze upon the unpainted
dwelling owned by the Widow Jones. The old house
was some distance away, but visible through the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that runaway boy?&rdquo; he reminded the
Cubs. &ldquo;He was taken back to Mrs. Jones&rsquo; House,
wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. Squatting beside
the fire, he had listened with interest to the speculation
of the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bet a cent he went off with our food!&rdquo;
Chips announced. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the house and find
out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; cried Midge. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to let him
get by with it, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, boys,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaping to pretty fast conclusions, in my
opinion. It would be a mistake&mdash;one of the worst
kind&mdash;to go to Mrs. Jones and complain about the
boy. We might be doing him a rank injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the tramp,&rdquo; added Brad significantly.
&ldquo;A second ago, you fellows were equally
sure he was the culprit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t do any harm to go to the house
and inquire,&rdquo; Chips insisted. &ldquo;We could be sort of&mdash;&rdquo;
he groped for a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discreet?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hatfield, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had intended to stop at the Jones&rsquo; house anyway,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield admitted, starting to stamp out
the dying coals. &ldquo;But my purpose is entirely friendly.
I&rsquo;m curious to learn how Jack is getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go,&rdquo; Chips urged. &ldquo;We want to see if he&rsquo;s
well fed&mdash;especially on biscuits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips, I&rsquo;m a bit uncertain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll watch myself,&rdquo; the boy assured him
quickly. &ldquo;You can do most of the talking. We&rsquo;ll just
listen and keep our eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can depend on you,&rdquo; the Cub leader
nodded. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s clean camp. It&rsquo;s getting on
toward dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs put out the fire, covering the smoking
coals with loose dirt. Their knapsacks loaded, they
soon were ready to hit the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield warned as
the group approached the Jones dwelling, &ldquo;even if
you are suspicious, don&rsquo;t make any accusations. Jack
already is in a bad spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we complain that he stole our food, Mrs. Jones
might send him straight back to the Institute,&rdquo; added
Brad. &ldquo;We ought to be dead sure of our ground
before we open our lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smoke curled from the chimney of the widow&rsquo;s
house, so the Cubs knew someone was at home. The
yard remained untidy, reminding them that they still
had a Saturday task before them.</p>
<p>However, there was evidence that someone had
been doing considerable work. Kindling wood had
been cut and cord wood neatly sawed and stacked
by the sagging porch.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield rapped on the door. In a moment,
Mrs. Jones appeared in her kitchen apron, smiling
as she saw the Cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>The Cub leader politely told her he had come to
inquire how Jack Phillips was getting along.</p>
<p>Immediately Mrs. Jones looked troubled. &ldquo;That
boy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If I haven&rsquo;t had a handful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he hasn&rsquo;t been giving you a bad time,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, and no. There&rsquo;s good stuff in the lad,
but he&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping him at home is one of them, I judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones drew a deep sigh. &ldquo;Jack is off somewhere
this very minute. Early this morning I told
him to cut the wood. He went through the job like
a house afire, and then before I knew it, he was
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wandering the woods perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that boy is like a wild things with his love of
the outdoors. He went off for three hours yesterday
and I gave him a switching when he came back. But
it didn&rsquo;t prevent him from trying the same trick
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield smiled as the widow mentioned the
switching. She was a frail little woman, weighing a
scant one hundred pounds. Jack, by contrast, was
built like a football player and heavy for his age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the switching hurt him any,&rdquo; Mrs.
Jones said. &ldquo;The scamp sort of laughed while I was
doing it. I&rsquo;m right provoked at him today though. He
took the rifle when he left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s rather dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack&rsquo;s a good shot,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones informed him.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind him using the gun, if he&rsquo;d ask me
for it. It&rsquo;s those sneaking ways of his that annoy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Hatfield,
reflecting upon the missing biscuits. &ldquo;Well, be patient
with the lad. He may develop. And if there&rsquo;s anything
I can do, call on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could round that boy up and send him
home, I&rsquo;d appreciate it,&rdquo; the widow sighed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no telling where he is, or when he&rsquo;ll come dragging
in&mdash;if at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had any serious trouble with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow hesitated. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t wanted to report
his behavior to the Court officials, because if I do, I
know they&rsquo;ll pack him off to the industrial school.
I&rsquo;m trying to give him a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has caused you worry? There&rsquo;s more to it
than restlessness and running away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a few things have disappeared,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones
admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;Nothing of much value, but
it bothers me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are some of the things that have been
taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack always is sneaking into the ice box. He&rsquo;ll
pack himself a lunch and disappear for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A typical boy&rsquo;s trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not complaining about the food. Though
it plagues me that he doesn&rsquo;t come right out honest
like and ask for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy takes other things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my black silk dresses disappeared. I&rsquo;d dry
cleaned it with gasoline and hung it up in the shed
to air out. To tell you the truth, I forgot about it for
several days. When I went to get it, well it was
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would Jack want with a black silk dress?&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield questioned dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell!&rdquo; Mrs. Jones made a despairing gesture.
&ldquo;He chops wood and then half of it disappears before
I can pop it into the stove. I think he carries it off to
build fires in the woods and marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious that he would take a dress,&rdquo; said the
Cub leader with a puzzled shake of his head. &ldquo;The
other things more or less fit in with his overpowering
desire to lead an outdoor life. But a woman&rsquo;s dress!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was an old one without much value,&rdquo; Mrs.
Jones admitted. &ldquo;I liked it though, on account of the
pretty jet buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of jet buttons, Dan shot Mr. Hatfield
a quick glance. He saw that the Cub leader likewise
was startled by the possibility which presented itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of buttons, were they?&rdquo; the boy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tiny jet buttons, diamond in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find the boy, we&rsquo;ll send him home,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said hastily.</p>
<p>He was afraid that Dan or one of the other Cubs
might say something which would further disturb
the widow.</p>
<p>Herding the boys together, he led them away
from the house. Once beyond hearing of the widow,
they all had plenty to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack swiped our biscuits all right!&rdquo; Red said indignantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re saps to let him get by with it
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have him sent back to the Child
Study Institute!&rdquo; added Midge. &ldquo;Who does that kid
think he is? We ought to clip his comb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had not given much thought to the
stolen food. However, he was gravely troubled by
Mrs. Jones&rsquo; reference to the jet buttons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Jack was the one who came to
your house that morning?&rdquo; Dan asked, falling into
step with the Cub leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, it raises a question in one&rsquo;s mind, Dan.
But for the life of me, I can&rsquo;t understand how he
would know about the tin box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, he didn&rsquo;t live here at the time the
money disappeared from your house, Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Dan!&rdquo; the Cub leader exclaimed, obviously
relieved. &ldquo;For a minute I was afraid of the
worst. It only goes to prove one shouldn&rsquo;t jump to
conclusions. Guess I&rsquo;ve said that a dozen times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cubs reached the main road, Chips called
attention to a curl of smoke rising lazily from the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must have a camp fire back in there,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rather dangerous place to start a fire,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said. &ldquo;Suppose we investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning aside from the road, the Cubs climbed a
rail fence and made their way through the thickets.
Picking a trail carefully, Mr. Hatfield led them single
file.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, boys,&rdquo; he advised as Babe kept shuffling
his feet through the dry leaves. &ldquo;No use advertising
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Before the Cubs had gone far into the woods, they
could smell the aroma of food cooking.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield signaled for the boys to slow their
pace. Treading noiselessly, they approached with
caution.</p>
<p>At the edge of a small clearing the Cub leader
abruptly halted.</p>
<p>Eager to see what it was that had drawn and held
their leaders attention, the boys closed in about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that!&rdquo; Dan whispered.</p>
<p>Directly ahead was a wind-sheltered hollow,
framed by bare trees. A camp fire had been built
close to the banks of a winding stream. On a crudely
constructed spit, a dressed rabbit slowly broiled
over the coals.</p>
<p>The one who turned the spit had his back to the
Cubs. He was wrapped deeply in a heavy coat many
sizes too large for his lean frame. Beside him lay a
rifle.</p>
<p>But even though the Cubs could not see the lad&rsquo;s
face, they recognized him instantly. The one who
sat so contentedly by his fire, gazing off into space,
was Jack Phillips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER 15</span>
<br />A Hint from Jack</h2>
<p>Mr. Hatfield did not fail to note the rifle, which
he knew had been taken from Mrs. Jones&rsquo; home. Undoubtedly
it was loaded, he reasoned. If Jack were
disposed to make trouble, he easily could do so.</p>
<p>Saying nothing to the Cubs of his misgivings, the
Cub leader stepped boldly into the clearing.</p>
<p>Hearing the crackle of a stick, Jack whirled
around.</p>
<p>Instinctively, he reached for the rifle. Then, recognizing
Mr. Hatfield, he merely allowed his hand to
rest on the butt. His attitude however, was wary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Jack?&rdquo; the Cub leader greeted him.
&ldquo;A nice little camp you have here. Did you shoot the
rabbit yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; Jack retorted a trifle defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did a good job of cleaning it too,&rdquo; the Cub
leader praised him. &ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re handy and
know how to get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made no reply. Guardedly he eyed the Cubs,
who gradually had circled in around the camp fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No biscuits?&rdquo; demanded Red, scanning every
inch of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never learned how to bake &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Jack admitted,
relaxing a bit. &ldquo;You have to have an oven for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reflector oven isn&rsquo;t hard to make,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said. &ldquo;Any of the Cubs could teach you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could?&rdquo; Jack gazed at the boys with new
respect. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come with us on our next hike, and we&rsquo;ll
show you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a Cub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference. Glad to have you.&rdquo;
Jack&rsquo;s face lighted up, and then the old look of
frustration returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t make it. The
Widow wouldn&rsquo;t let me go. She keeps me chop, chop,
chopping wood night and day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be enjoying yourself now,&rdquo; Brad remarked
significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Jack stirred the coals and replied: &ldquo;Oh, I ran off.
She&rsquo;ll switch me when I get back. It only tickles
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield squatted by the fire and said in a
friendly way: &ldquo;How are things working out, Jack?
You don&rsquo;t much like it at the Widow&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s okay, I guess,&rdquo; the boy admitted grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She makes you work too hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to chop a lot of wood. I hate that. The
other work isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jones doesn&rsquo;t have much money or any man
to help her about the place. Jack, she really needs
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; the boy admitted uncomfortably.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to please her. It&rsquo;s just&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t
stand being cooped up in the house all the time.
Every so often I have to get away or I&rsquo;ll pop wide
open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;Had that
feeling myself when I was a boy. I never gave way
to the urge too much, and I made a point never to
take anything that didn&rsquo;t belong to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rocked back on his heels, regarding the Cub
leader with hostility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that crack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you swipe our biscuits?&rdquo; Red demanded
before Mr. Hatfield could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone took them from our camp,&rdquo; Red went
on, ignoring Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s warning glance. &ldquo;If you
didn&rsquo;t swipe &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t and you better not accuse me! I&rsquo;ve
been right here for the last forty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using Mrs. Jones&rsquo; rifle!&rdquo; Red accused, refusing
to be checked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? She never touched it. A rifle was meant
to be used not left to rust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jones thinks you&rsquo;ve been taking things from
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a black lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cord wood for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would I steal wood for, when I have to keep
chopping more to replace it?&rdquo; Jack shouted furiously.
&ldquo;Use your head, or haven&rsquo;t you got one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Hatfield warned Red to drop the
argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; the boy mumbled.</p>
<p>Jack however, was not willing to allow the matter
to pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What else did Mrs. Jones say I took?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall that she accused you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
answered. &ldquo;She merely was disturbed because of the
wood and a few other trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone else had been taking that wood. What
else did she say was missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black dress,&rdquo; Dan answered. &ldquo;One with jet
buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have any use for
a woman&rsquo;s dress,&rdquo; Dan went on, watching the boy
intently.</p>
<p>Jack made no reply. After a long while, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take that dress. If I were a mind to
though, I could tell you something about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you do just that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield encouraged
him.</p>
<p>Jack smiled in a superior, insolent way. The wave
of friendliness which he briefly had displayed, now
was entirely gone. Once more he seemed the arrogant,
defiant runaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I tell you anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, Jack. We have
a particular reason for being interested in what became
of that black silk dress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve accused me of being a thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack. The Cubs were a bit abrupt perhaps.
They believe in being square and honest. Naturally
it made them sore to think you might have taken the
biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we accept your word, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you said I took wood and the Widow&rsquo;s black
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack, we merely were telling you what she
said. Unfortunately, when one has a past record, it&rsquo;s
apt to plague one unjustly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m a bad kid! I know!&rdquo; Jack said, his eyes
flashing. &ldquo;Okay! Send me to an industrial school! But
try to keep me there! I&rsquo;ll run away a thousand times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking wildly now, Jack. No one wants to
send you away. Quite the opposite. Mrs. Jones likes
you. She&rsquo;s willing to overlook a lot to keep you with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been pretty decent to me,&rdquo; Jack admitted,
softening again. &ldquo;I did take food out of the ice box
without asking her. Not very much though. Just
enough so I could get along out here in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s worried about you now, Jack. She asked
me to send you home, if I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Jack sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d intended to anyhow
as soon as this rabbit finishes cooking. It&rsquo;s done now,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy removed the rabbit from the spit, and
salted it, using a shaker which the Cubs were certain
had come from Mrs. Jones&rsquo; home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some?&rdquo; he invited the Cubs.</p>
<p>They declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; Jack announced.</p>
<p>Dismembering the rabbit, he gnawed at the tough
meat. Now and then as he ate, he glanced at the
Cubs.</p>
<p>Having finished his meal, he put out the fire and
cleaned away the debris. The Cubs noted that he
was efficient at it, leaving not a spark which could
set off a forest fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to Mrs. Jones&rsquo; place now and chop
more wood,&rdquo; Jack said finally, picking up the rifle.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chop and chop until my hands bleed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think Mrs. Jones will require that,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said, smiling. &ldquo;By the way, Jack, who do
you figure may be taking that wood?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The boy gave him a quick, knowing look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t stay up nights watching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have a fairly good idea where it is
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, if you wanted to cooperate, you could be
very helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind my own business. That&rsquo;s more than I can
say about some folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His resentment returning, Jack glared at the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys think you&rsquo;re so smart and know so
much about camping out and the like!&rdquo; he scoffed.
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re babes in the woods! If you weren&rsquo;t so
dumb, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to ask so many stupid
questions. You&rsquo;d see for yourselves what&rsquo;s going on
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you conceited&mdash;&rdquo; Red began, but Dan
checked him with a hard kick in the ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we are sort of dumb,&rdquo; Brad said, falling
in with Jack&rsquo;s mood. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right, we
don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on around here. That&rsquo;s because
we&rsquo;re not on the scene much of the time.
You&rsquo;re roaming the woods and the marsh every day.
I suppose you&rsquo;ve seen things we haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re darn right I have,&rdquo; Jack boasted. &ldquo;I could
tell you something about that black dress, if I had
a mind to! What&rsquo;s more, I could tell you about the
money box&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy broke off, suddenly aware that he was
talking entirely too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the money box?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked
quietly.</p>
<p>Jack, however, started off through the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Dan called after him.</p>
<p>Jack turned around, but his eyes were unfriendly
and defiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get anything out of me!&rdquo; he taunted
the Cubs. &ldquo;I could tell you a lot if I wanted to. But
I won&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m not forgetting that it was the Cubs who
took me back to the Child Study Institute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER 16</span>
<br />Inside the Log</h2>
<p>Jack Phillip&rsquo;s hint that he was in possession of
vital information relative to the missing money box
amazed the Cubs.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Hatfield was so taken by surprise that
for the moment he made no attempt to detain the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are we going to let him get away again?&rdquo;
Brad demanded. &ldquo;He knows what became of that
money box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took it himself, that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo; muttered Chips.
&ldquo;Who does he think he is, anyhow? Someone that
doesn&rsquo;t have to obey the law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack does have a few things to explain,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said quietly. &ldquo;Now, take it easy, boys. He&rsquo;ll
not elude us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heading for the road now!&rdquo; Red said excitedly.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t stop him quick, he&rsquo;ll slip away
and we may never see him again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll head him off,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied, undisturbed.
&ldquo;Brad, you and Dan and Midge start
through the hollow which is shorter than the path
he&rsquo;s taken. The rest of us will come up from the
rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Brad said eagerly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just circle in and don&rsquo;t use any force. In fact,
don&rsquo;t try to hold him until I get there. He has a rifle,
you know. It may or may not be loaded, but we&rsquo;re
taking no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Brad promised, already starting
off with Midge and Dan.</p>
<p>At a fast lope, the three boys followed the low
ground. For a considerable distance they were unable
to see the boy they pursued.</p>
<p>However, as they came presently to a rise of
ground, they glimpsed him off to the right not far
from the main road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking it easy,&rdquo; Brad said in relief. &ldquo;I guess
he doesn&rsquo;t suspect we&rsquo;re following him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we show ourselves?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need to yet, Dan. The minute we do, he&rsquo;ll
either defy us or start to run. We&rsquo;ll just keep him in
sight until Mr. Hatfield catches up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s what he told us to do,&rdquo; Midge said
nervously. &ldquo;No telling how the kid may react.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without glancing around, Jack made his way directly
to the road. Once he paused to stare at the
crotch of a tree which had been split by lightning.</p>
<p>Another time, hearing the crackle of a stick, he
looked quickly over his shoulder. Brad, Dan and
Midge froze in their positions and the boy did not
see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heading for the road all right,&rdquo; Brad observed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to beat him to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping back into the hollow, the three Cubs
hastened on. Presently, they emerged at a point
where they had calculated Jack would come out of
the woods.</p>
<p>Nor were they mistaken. In a moment, before they
fully had caught their breath, they saw him coming.</p>
<p>Jack was whistling a slightly off-key tune. Seeing
the three boys in front of him, he broke off and
stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>The moment was a tense one for the three Cubs.
They were relieved though that Jack made no
attempt to draw his rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; he demanded, trying to shove
past them.</p>
<p>The Cubs stood their ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield wants to talk to you,&rdquo; Brad said
pleasantly. &ldquo;You raised a few points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn nothing more from me!&rdquo; Jack retorted.
&ldquo;I told you that! Let me past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad, Dan and Midge refused to move. Jack
glared at them, and then whirled, evidently intending
to run.</p>
<p>However, he found retreat also blocked.</p>
<p>During the brief conversation, Mr. Hatfield, his
son, Fred, Chips, Red and Babe quietly had come
up from the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea?&rdquo; Jack repeated furiously.
&ldquo;You got nothing on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a signal from Mr. Hatfield, the Cubs closed
about the boy in a tight circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand over the rifle, Jack,&rdquo; the Cub leader
ordered. &ldquo;You handle it very well for a boy of your
age, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have taken it from Mrs. Jones
without her permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, she never used it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, it was her property. The rifle,
Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The boy seemed on the verge of defying the Cub
leader. Then, he thought through the matter, and
with a gesture of contempt, extended the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t loaded,&rdquo; the boy muttered. &ldquo;You got
nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield checked the rifle for himself, finding
that Jack had spoken the truth. Evidently he had
used his last shot on the rabbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you aim to do? Turn me over to the cops
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on what you tell us, Jack. From
the start, we&rsquo;ve tried to give you the benefit of every
doubt. Your remarks about the tin box, however,
were disturbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has accused you, Jack. It&rsquo;s clear though,
that you know plenty about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read about it in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know more than the facts you have
read, Jack. Why don&rsquo;t you come clean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You turned me in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re law abiding citizens, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
argued. &ldquo;What else could we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I help only my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are your friends,&rdquo; the Cub leader insisted.
&ldquo;At least we want to be. Sit down, Jack, and let&rsquo;s
talk this over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield brushed off a hollow log which had
fallen near the fence, and made room for Jack. The
other boys gathered around close enough so the Institute
lad could not hope to make a break for freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, can&rsquo;t you realize that we&rsquo;re trying to help,
not make things hard for you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield attempted
to reason with him. &ldquo;You must return to
Mrs. Jones&rsquo; home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going there anyhow,&rdquo; the boy muttered, his
gaze on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t running away again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Course not,&rdquo; Jack said irritably. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go
away and take her rifle. I&rsquo;m not a thief. She&rsquo;s been
good to me in her way&mdash;better than anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield exclaimed.
&ldquo;I knew you had good stuff if you&rsquo;d just give it a
chance to come out. Now about the money box&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you hinted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just blowing,&rdquo; Jack said, avoiding Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s
direct gaze. &ldquo;All I know is what I read in the
newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The Cubs were disgusted. But Jack, they knew,
did not abide by their standards of honor and fair
play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go now,&rdquo; Jack muttered, getting up from
the log. &ldquo;You got no right to keep me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have your word that you&rsquo;ll return to Mrs.
Jones&rsquo; house?&rdquo; the Cub leader asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I would, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept your word, Jack. And here&rsquo;s the rifle.
When you return it to Mrs. Jones, why not ask her
if you may borrow it now and then? She&rsquo;d likely give
her consent and you wouldn&rsquo;t feel low and sneaking
about it. Furthermore, in season you probably could
help out by bringing in game for the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she would let me take it,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Sure,
I&rsquo;ll ask her next time. I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield smiled and reached out to shake the
boy&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do all right.
I&rsquo;m confident of it. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An odd expression came over the Cub leader&rsquo;s
face. Without finishing what he had started to say,
he stooped down to examine one end of the hollow
log.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>The Cubs then saw what had attracted their
leader&rsquo;s attention. A bit of water-soaked cloth protruded
from the end of the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield murmured.</p>
<p>As the boys watched in amazement, he removed
a wadded-up garment. The Cub leader shook it out,
revealing a woman&rsquo;s black dress trimmed in diamond-shaped
jet buttons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that must be the costume stolen from Mrs.
Jones&rsquo; place!&rdquo; exclaimed Brad as Mr. Hatfield spread
the garment over the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, the same one maybe that was worn by the
thief who made off with the money box!&rdquo; added Dan,
becoming highly excited.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield carefully examined the diamond-shaped
buttons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they the same as the one police found in
your desk?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly look the same,&rdquo; the Cub leader
admitted. &ldquo;I wonder how this dress came to be in
the log?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must have stuffed it in here just to be
rid of it,&rdquo; Brad ventured.</p>
<p>His gaze fastened upon Jack Phillips. The boy
leaned on his rifle, staring at the dress with a fixed,
almost frozen expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Observing the odd look of his eyes, the Cubs could
not fail to wonder what he knew of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield, without mincing words,
&ldquo;have you ever seen this dress before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I seen it?&rdquo; the boy echoed indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I asked, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never saw the dress before!&rdquo; the boy
answered sullenly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more I didn&rsquo;t put it in
this old log! I had nothing to do with stealing your
money box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding this dress here gave me a bad moment,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;Frankly, it&rsquo;s something of a
shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, blame me! I always get accused of everything
whether I did it or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has accused you of anything, Jack. We
only want to get at the truth of the matter. I have a
deep-seated feeling that you might help us, if only
you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack remained silent.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield examined the dress and then wrapped
it into a tight roll.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, we&rsquo;ll walk along with you to Mrs. Jones&rsquo;
place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think this is the dress that disappeared
from her shed. I want to find out for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; Jack denied. &ldquo;What would I
want with a woman&rsquo;s dress? If you go back and tell
the widow, she&rsquo;ll think I stole it! She&rsquo;ll send me back
to the Institute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you tell a straight story, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
reassured him. &ldquo;Come along, boys. We&rsquo;re wasting
valuable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not openly defy Mr. Hatfield or the Cubs,
but he made it evident by glances he directed at
them that he resented their interference.</p>
<p>As the group approached the old farmhouse, Mrs.
Jones saw the boys from afar. She was waiting at
the door when they came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see you caught the rascal!&rdquo; she commented
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found him,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield corrected. &ldquo;Jack
wasn&rsquo;t running away though. He said he intended to
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, why do you do it?&rdquo; the widow asked, taking
the rifle from him. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been good to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; the boy responded, his eyes on the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you some victuals. You must be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough to eat. I&rsquo;m sorry about taking so
much from the refrigerator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tight lines around Mrs. Jones&rsquo; mouth relaxed.
&ldquo;There! I reckon boys are all alike,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;I had three of my own once. I never could break
&rsquo;em of taking cookies from the jar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow cordially invited the Cubs into the
kitchen. Mr. Hatfield declined the invitation for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jones, here is something we wish to show
you,&rdquo; he said, exposing the rolled-up black gown to
her gaze. &ldquo;Did you ever see this dress before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land sakes! It&rsquo;s the dress that disappeared from
the shed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain it&rsquo;s the same one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m certain. Didn&rsquo;t I wear that dress for
six years? Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a hollow log not far from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all places! How did it get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know myself. Dan tells me
that someone in a black dress was seen leaving my
place on the day the money box disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jet button exactly like those on the dress was
found by police in Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s study,&rdquo; Brad contributed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! Then you think the money was taken
by someone who wore my dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, one wonders,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones gazed searchingly at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; he said, almost fiercely. &ldquo;Quit
lookin&rsquo; at me like that! I always get the blame for
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Jack didn&rsquo;t take the dress,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
declared. &ldquo;As I recall, Mrs. Jones, I believe you said
it disappeared some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! Before Jack came here! Land sakes, I
guess we get so in the habit of blaming a boy, that
we don&rsquo;t give him the benefit of any doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a gesture of kindness, she reached out and drew
the boy to her. He resisted, but as her arm remained
firm, finally allowed it to remain thrown around his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly convinced Jack didn&rsquo;t take the dress,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield resumed. &ldquo;Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m afraid I
can&rsquo;t say I think he isn&rsquo;t hiding vital information. I
believe Jack knows more about the affair than he is
willing to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones&rsquo; arm fell from the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.
Sternly, she regarded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, is that the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo; The boy regarded her defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you just tell Mr. Hatfield everything you
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild horses can&rsquo;t drag it from me! I&rsquo;m no
snitcher. I don&rsquo;t help anyone who made it hard for
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little ninny!&rdquo; Mrs. Jones exclaimed, losing
patience. &ldquo;I declare, I wonder if you have an ounce
of sense. Now march into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Jack muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone come in,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones invited. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
thrash this out right here and now. If there&rsquo;s one
thing I can&rsquo;t stand it&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs trooped into the warm kitchen, fairly
overflowing the tiny room. Mr. Hatfield, Babe, Chips
and Fred found chairs. Dan perched himself on the
corner of the wood box by the stove. The others
stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I&rsquo;d try to switch a little sense into you, but
I know now it doesn&rsquo;t do a mite of good,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones
sighed. &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s wrong with you anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you speak up and tell Mr. Hatfield
and the Cubs what they want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They turned me in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it was mighty inconsiderate of &rsquo;em to
give you another chance,&rdquo; the widow said, her brittle
voice edged with sarcasm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a hard lot
here. I&rsquo;ve kept you chopping wood every day and
helping with the housework. At night you&rsquo;ve had to
do your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work wasn&rsquo;t so hard,&rdquo; Jack muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been chained to the house&mdash;never could
go away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, quit rubbin&rsquo; it in,&rdquo; Jack pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve liked
it here. I&rsquo;m willing to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow regarded him steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be willing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want
you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack drew in his breath and for a moment could
not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re sending me back?&rdquo; he finally stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as fast as I can send for Mr. Wentworth. I
did the best I could for you, Jack. I needed a boy I
could depend on that would help me with the work,
and act like my own son. Well, you let me down. So
I&rsquo;ll go on living here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>The words cut deep into Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better,&rdquo; he
promised. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t send me back to the Institute.
I&rsquo;ll cut all the wood you want me to&mdash;honest I
will. I won&rsquo;t take things out of the ice box again or
run off so often. Only just once in a long while, when
I get to feeling tight and mean inside. And I&rsquo;ll tell
you ahead that I&rsquo;m going&mdash;I promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re promising a heap, Jack,&rdquo; the widow returned
dryly. &ldquo;Only trouble is, you&rsquo;ve made a lot of
&rsquo;em before you never kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never made any to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a fact. You have kept your word
such as you&rsquo;ve given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me have another chance. Just one
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you tell the truth about that black
dress of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never took it!&rdquo; Jack said desperately. &ldquo;Believe
me, I never did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know how it came to be in the hollow
log?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for sure,&rdquo; Jack hedged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could make a pretty shrewd guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose you come clean and tell the Cubs
everything you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help &rsquo;em after they turned me in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they really do you such a bad turn seeing to
it that you were sent out here to my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Jack murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all mixed up. I don&rsquo;t
know what to do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to stay with me always, Jack. You&rsquo;re
a fine boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that? You ain&rsquo;t just handing me a line
so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll do what you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really mean it, Jack. You should know by this
time that when I give my word I keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack debated with himself only a moment longer.
Then he arrived at his decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to stay here,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
whatever you tell me to&mdash;and I ain&rsquo;t crossin&rsquo; my
fingers when I say it, either! You can switch me
whenever you want to and I won&rsquo;t try to take the
switch away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s right considerate of you, Jack,&rdquo; Mrs.
Jones smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get along fine from now on. And
we won&rsquo;t need that switch again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fill the woodbox,&rdquo; Jack offered eagerly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re most out of kindling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones hauled him up short. &ldquo;That job can
wait, Jack. You got something else more important
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us everything you know about the tin box,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield urged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be doing the Cubs a real
service, Jack. You see, not only myself but the entire
organization has been under a cloud since the money
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sure what became of it, but I may know,&rdquo;
Jack admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose you tell us,&rdquo; the Cub leader urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you instead,&rdquo; Jack offered. &ldquo;Follow me
to the woods, and you may see something kinda
interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER 17</span>
<br />Through the Window</h2>
<p>Skirting the marsh, Jack led the Cubs deep into
the shadowy woods. Apparently he had gone that
way often, for he seldom hesitated in choosing the
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think he&rsquo;s taking us?&rdquo; Dan speculated,
bringing up the rear with Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has me guessing, Dan. He seems to know
where&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s going though. I have a hunch he may
show us something that will have an important bearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brisk five-minute hike through the woods,
Jack abruptly halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to see anything, you got to be quiet
from here on,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>All conversation ceased. Still led by Jack, the Cubs
moved on at a slower pace. Carefully they trod, taking
care not to step on sticks or dry leaves.</p>
<p>Presently Jack again halted. This time he did not
speak.</p>
<p>However, the Cubs, gathering close about, saw
that they had neared their destination.</p>
<p>Directly ahead, in a tiny clearing close to the
stream, stood a crude shack. Side walls were badly
built from odd-shaped lumber which the Cubs
guessed had been taken from near-by construction
jobs.</p>
<p>The flat roof was made of tar paper. Some of it
had torn loose and flapped in the light breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t build the shack?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield whispered
to Jack. He had noted a tiny curl of smoke
rising lazily from a tin pipe cut through the roof.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. Motioning for the Cubs to
follow, he moved in a little closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lives there?&rdquo; Brad whispered, impatient for
information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get in close, and maybe
you can see for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we all move in, we&rsquo;ll likely be seen,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>It was decided that Jack, Mr. Hatfield, Brad and
Dan should go on ahead, leaving the others in the
shelter of the trees.</p>
<p>Moving softly over the uneven ground, the trio
crept close to the shack. Keeping close to the wall,
they reached a broken pane of glass which served
as the only window.</p>
<p>Jack pressed his face against it and nodded in
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there! Have a look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack moved back to allow Dan to take his place.</p>
<p>The boy peered into the dark interior of the shack.
At first he caught only an impression of an empty
room with an old box which served as a table.</p>
<p>Then gradually he made out a balsam-bough bed
on the floor, covered with an army blanket. Sprawled
on the bed, fully clothed was a man with a stubbly
beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that same fellow who looked in the church
window!&rdquo; Dan murmured, startled to recognize him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield warned, for in his
excitement, the boy very nearly had spoken aloud.
&ldquo;Let me have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan moved aside so that both the Cub leader and
Brad might peer at the stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same man all right,&rdquo; Brad confirmed Dan&rsquo;s
identification. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead to the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had turned to Jack. &ldquo;This is all very
interesting,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;But you promised to
show us something that might explain about the
missing money box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t show you while he&rsquo;s in there. But he&rsquo;s
got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Jack thoroughly enjoyed his knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this, Jack? Did you see the
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right from this very window. I was wandering
through the woods late one afternoon when I came
onto this shack. I was curious, so I sneaked up and
looked in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this same tramp was living in there?&rdquo; Dan
asked. &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t find the shack until a couple of days
ago. I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the money box,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I looked through the window, I saw that
tramp take it out from under his bed. While I
watched, he counted the money. I saw a lot of bills
in neat stacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; Dan whispered. &ldquo;It must be the money
we found in the church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hunk of baloney saw us through the window,
and probably found out that the box was
taken to Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Brad reasoned. &ldquo;But
how did he get it from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember Mrs. Jones&rsquo; black dress!&rdquo; Dan reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I get it. He must have stolen it from her
place and wore the garment when he slipped into
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the milkman reported seeing a woman
leave the place,&rdquo; Dan nodded, peering again through
the window. &ldquo;The dope still is sleeping hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After stealing the money, it&rsquo;s odd he didn&rsquo;t try
to get away from here,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield thought aloud.
&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get back and report to the Cubs. It&rsquo;s
risky standing here in the open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After taking one more peek through the dirty
pane of glass, the boys followed the Cub leader to
the shelter of trees. There they were bombarded
with a multitude of questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s march into that shack in a body and make
that tramp give up the money!&rdquo; Chips proposed
boldly. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have him arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you putting the cart before the horse?&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far wiser to have him
arrested first and let the police demand the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Brad. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t arresting
officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tramp may sleep another hour or perhaps
only five minutes,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said uneasily. &ldquo;Tell
you what! I&rsquo;ll take Red and head for the nearest telephone.
The rest of you stay here in the woods.
Watch the shack but keep out of sight. I&rsquo;ll be back
as soon as I can call police or a state trooper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let him get away,&rdquo; Dan promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad&rsquo;s in charge,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said as he and
Red started off through the woods. &ldquo;Obey his orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Cub leader had gone, Brad told the
boys to spread out a little and to flatten themselves
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, I want to take a peek into that window!&rdquo;
Chips announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Dan got a chance to look. I guess if you
did, the rest of us can too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s take turns,&rdquo; proposed Midge.</p>
<p>Brad gave him a withering look. &ldquo;Am I going to
have trouble with you guys?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield didn&rsquo;t say we couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chips
argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your head. You know if we all start going
back and forth to that window, sooner or later we&rsquo;ll
be seen. We have an important job to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Dan supported the older boy.
&ldquo;And Brad&rsquo;s in charge. What he says goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right for you,&rdquo; Chips argued. &ldquo;You
already had your look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Jack Phillips now entered the discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, you!&rdquo; he flung at the astonished
Chips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re yapping like a baby. We do as Mr.
Hatfield said&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips and Midge both subsided.</p>
<p>Time passed very slowly. Brad began to think it
was taking Mr. Hatfield and Red a long while to
telephone police. The Cubs, he could see, were
growing cold and restless. Babe in particular, who
had not dressed warmly enough, huddled against
the older boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer will it be?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sure wish I knew,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;Listen, Babe.
You&rsquo;re shivering. Why don&rsquo;t you hike to Mrs. Jones&rsquo;
place and warm yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babe shook his head. &ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; he said
stoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as tough as the other fellows any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another five minutes elapsed. Brad was shifting
into a more comfortable position, when Dan gripped
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Brad!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>The door of the shack had opened. For a moment
the tramp stood there in his wrinkled clothes, gazing
directly toward the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie still, fellows!&rdquo; Brad ordered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
he sees us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he going to do next?&rdquo; Dan speculated
uneasily.</p>
<p>The tramp stretched himself, and wandering
down to the stream, washed his face. After taking
a drink, he re-entered the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope he stays there,&rdquo; Chips whispered.</p>
<p>The wish was a futile one. A minute or two later,
the tramp reappeared, carrying a few cooking
utensils.</p>
<p>Turning his back to the Cubs, he followed the
curve of the creek and vanished from sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is he leaving for good?&rdquo; whispered Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Jack Phillips answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen him cook his food in a rock shelter about a
hundred yards down-stream. He doesn&rsquo;t dare have
a fire inside the shack, or he&rsquo;d likely burn it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same it&rsquo;s our job to keep him in sight until
the police get here,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Jack, suppose
you and Fred follow and find out where he goes.
Report back as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; agreed Jack, liking the assignment. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t let him get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he should lead you a chase, mark the trail,&rdquo;
the Den Chief advised. &ldquo;Fred knows how to do it
so the Cubs can follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred and Jack hastened off in pursuit of the
tramp. However, it seemed they scarcely had disappeared
until they returned again, breathless from
hurrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; Jack reassured him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I
thought. The tramp is cooking his meal. He&rsquo;ll be at
it a half hour at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, we ought to keep him in sight,&rdquo;
Brad decided. &ldquo;You two hustle back and watch. If
he starts this way, give some sort of signal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be?&rdquo; Fred asked. &ldquo;I know! I&rsquo;ll whistle
like a whippoorwill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any of &rsquo;em in the woods at this time
of year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the tramp won&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; Fred said. &ldquo;I could
give my siren whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the whippoorwill signal will be better,&rdquo; Brad
decided quickly. &ldquo;That siren of yours would send
him hot-footing in the opposite direction. But don&rsquo;t
use any signal unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had the two gone off, than Chips again
urged that the Cubs investigate the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack said the tramp will be tied up for a half
hour,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;This is our chance! We can get
in there and find the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Mr. Hatfield would want us to do it!&rdquo;
Midge backed him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it&rsquo;s sort of risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re too conservative,&rdquo; Chips said hotly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is afraid,&rdquo; Brad retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a
matter of common sense. If the tramp should catch
us here before the police arrive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck! We&rsquo;re seven to his one! What do we need?
An army?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>The taunt annoyed Brad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to do
what Mr. Hatfield would want us to,&rdquo; he retorted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so hot-headed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go in there yourself and search the shack!&rdquo;
Chips challenged. &ldquo;Or are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not, and you know it! I just have sense
enough to figure that the tramp could come back
here any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred and Jack are watching, aren&rsquo;t they? If the
fellow leaves the creek, they&rsquo;ll whistle. Go on! The
important thing is to get that box of money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad gazed thoughtfully toward the creek. From
a short distance away, he could see a few wisps of
smoke arising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll take a chance!&rdquo; he decided reluctantly.</p>
<p>Chips started for the shack, only to have Brad
haul him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dan and I will search the
shack. You and Midge and Babe stay here and keep
watch. If you hear a whistle, or see anyone coming,
give us a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some guys have all the fun!&rdquo; Chips complained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; Brad snorted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking the risk. Don&rsquo;t
forget, that tramp may be armed, either with a revolver
or a knife. If he should catch us in the shack,
he might give us a tough time of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re scared, let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you make me tired!&rdquo; Brad snapped in disgust.
&ldquo;Stay here and watch. Come on, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two darted across the clearing and opened
the door of the shack.</p>
<p>A few garments hung from pegs on the wall. An
orange crate had been fashioned into a table. Otherwise,
except for the balsam bed on the floor, the room
was bare.</p>
<p>Losing no time, Dan and Brad began to tear the
bed apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; Dan said in disappointment.
&ldquo;Wait&rdquo;&mdash;his hand struck a metal object buried deep
amid the carefully laid brush.</p>
<p>Triumphantly, he brought out the tin box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Dan!&rdquo; Brad praised. &ldquo;Is the money
still there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan raised the lid. The box appeared filled with
bills and coins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much can be missing at any rate,&rdquo; he said
in satisfaction. &ldquo;Finding this box will clear Mr. Hatfield
and the Cubs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now our only problem will be finding out who&rsquo;s
entitled to the money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys froze into alert attention. Faintly they
had heard a whistle from down-creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting out of
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that same moment, someone tapped on the
glass pane at the rear of the shack.</p>
<p>Whirling around, Brad and Dan saw Chips&rsquo; contorted
face pressed against the window. He motioned
frantically.</p>
<p>Seizing the tin box, Brad and Dan started for the
door.</p>
<p>Before they could reach it, heavy footsteps were
heard outside.</p>
<p>Then the door creaked back, and the tramp stood
there blocking the exit!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER 18</span>
<br />Pursuit</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the tramp unpleasantly. &ldquo;Visitors, I
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan gripped the tin box, standing close beside
Brad.</p>
<p>The shack had but one exit, the door which was
blocked by the tramp. Dan and Brad knew they
were in a spot. Their best bet was to stall for time,
hoping that the other Cubs would circle in from
the rear and come to their aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand over that box!&rdquo; the tramp ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Dan defied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give it up or I&rsquo;ll break every bone in your
body!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You stole the money from the church&mdash;or rather
from Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s place!&rdquo; Dan accused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
your box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand it over!&rdquo; the tramp ordered again, moving
a step closer. He reached his hand into his pocket
as if for a weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better do it, Dan,&rdquo; Brad advised quietly.</p>
<p>Even then the boy was reluctant to relinquish the
box.</p>
<p>Appraising his chances, he gazed beyond the
tramp. Through the open door he could see Chips
and Midge moving in closer.</p>
<p>A daring plan flashed into his mind. But should
he risk trying it? The chances were about even that
he would fail.</p>
<p>Chips was a star baseball player and his reactions
were fast. But would they be speedy enough?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, you!&rdquo; the tramp ordered again. &ldquo;Give me
that box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan no longer dared stall. Chips and Midge were
quite close to the door now, though not near enough
to attack the tramp from the rear. Behind the two,
almost in line were Fred and Jack who had hastened
up from the direction of the creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>For Dan&rsquo;s purpose, the line-up was very nearly
perfect. The moment had come. He had to take the
chance and hope that the other Cubs didn&rsquo;t muff it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll give you the box,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;CATCH!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even before Dan shouted the word, he had tossed
the box in a high arch over the tramp&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Belatedly the man made a leap for it, but he
clutched only air.</p>
<p>Behind him, the box was falling almost directly
into Chips&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it!&rdquo; shouted Dan.</p>
<p>Chips already was closing his hands upon the box.
He fumbled, recovered and held fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass it!&rdquo; shouted Dan. &ldquo;PASS!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command momentarily confused Chips. But
as the angry tramp started toward him, he suddenly
realized what Dan meant.</p>
<p>Pivoting, he shoved the box into Midge&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>By now, all the Cubs had caught onto the trick.</p>
<p>Midge ran a few steps and tossed the box to Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, you!&rdquo; shouted the tramp furiously.</p>
<p>Forgetting Dan and Brad, he started in pursuit
of Fred and the box.</p>
<p>The two boys ran out of the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make for Mrs. Jones&rsquo; place!&rdquo; Dan shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Fred was a fast runner and already had a long
start on the tramp.</p>
<p>But to the alarm of the Cubs, the man did not
give up the chase. Determined to recover the box,
he kept after him.</p>
<p>Brad rounded up Jack and the other Cubs, heading
for the road, by a shorter route. Anxiously, they
looked about for Mr. Hatfield and police officers,
but the highway was entirely deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s delayed them,&rdquo; Brad said anxiously,
scribbling a note which he speared on a barb of
the wire fence. &ldquo;I hope he finds this. I&rsquo;ve told him
to look for us at Mrs. Jones&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs had reached the road a minute or two
ahead of Fred. Soon they saw him rolling under a
fence thirty yards farther down the highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;He still has the
box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs raced to join Fred. Brad relieved him
of the money container.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop to pick any daisies!&rdquo; Fred panted.
&ldquo;That ape is right on my heels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it out with him!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seven to one&mdash;lots o&rsquo; fun!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading for Mrs. Jones&rsquo; place!&rdquo; Brad ordered
firmly. &ldquo;I think the fellow has a knife. We&rsquo;re
taking no chances on being carved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs loped off, leaving the tramp farther and
farther behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s given up the chase now,&rdquo; Midge said,
as they drew near the Jones&rsquo; home. &ldquo;No, by George!
He&rsquo;s still following!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what if Mrs. Jones isn&rsquo;t at home?&rdquo; Babe
quavered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dig up trouble,&rdquo; Dan advised him. &ldquo;Wait
until it nudges you in the shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pounded on the door with his fist. The Cubs
waited uneasily. The tramp had turned into the
lane and was running faster now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, boys!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I got something to tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably wants to give us a stick of candy!&rdquo;
Dan muttered. &ldquo;Oh, why doesn&rsquo;t Mrs. Jones open
the door&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, the widow did answer the knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us in and we&rsquo;ll explain later,&rdquo; Dan said
breathlessly. &ldquo;That tramp is after us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without asking questions, Mrs. Jones hustled the
Cubs into the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better lock the door,&rdquo; Brad advised, setting the
money box on the kitchen table. &ldquo;That bird may
try to break in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him!&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones. Nevertheless, she
locked the kitchen door as the boy had advised.</p>
<p>The Cubs barely had time to explain where they
had obtained the money, than the man was pounding
to be let in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Brad advised the widow. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
tough customer. Better let the police handle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips and Midge had gone to the window to
look out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, boys,&rdquo; Mrs. Jones ordered. &ldquo;If that
tramp is a criminal, he might take a shot through
the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alarmed, the two boys moved back out of range.</p>
<p>Outside, a door slammed as if in the wind. Mrs.
Jones, hearing the sound, stiffened.</p>
<p>Then, unmindful of her own warning to the Cubs,
she ran to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that sneak!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s opened
the double doors leading down into the basement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll be up here in another minute!&rdquo; Babe
quavered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones confidently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Moving across the kitchen, she locked the inside
door which led into the basement. As a double precaution,
she then placed the heavy oak table in
front of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should hold him,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I have
another little idea too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs could not guess what the widow was up
to as she darted out of the house, not even bothering
to put on a wrap.</p>
<p>In a moment though, they understood. Mrs. Jones
slammed shut the double doors entering into the
cellar, and bolted them.</p>
<p>As Dan and Brad ran out to help, she told them
to bring several pieces of heavy machinery from
the shed. These the boys trundled out and placed
on top of the double doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should hold him!&rdquo; Mrs. Jones declared, well
satisfied with her work.</p>
<p>From inside the house, they could hear the tramp
pounding on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may break it down!&rdquo; Dan said uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could,&rdquo; the widow admitted. &ldquo;Dan, run down
the road and see if you can find out what&rsquo;s keeping
Mr. Hatfield and the state troopers. Meanwhile,
the rest of us will hold the fort. Or to be strictly
accurate&mdash;the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER 19</span>
<br />&ldquo;I Promise&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Knowing that Mrs. Jones and the Cubs might not
be able to hold the tramp a prisoner very long in
the barricaded basement, Dan ran as fast as he
could down the road.</p>
<p>He had no idea which way Mr. Hatfield had
gone. However, it seemed to him that the house
most likely to have a telephone, was a large white
one a quarter of a mile farther on toward town.</p>
<p>Dan was midway there when he saw a state
trooper&rsquo;s car approaching. His heart leaped. Help,
he thought, was at hand.</p>
<p>Even before the boy signaled, the car came to a
grinding halt a short distance away. Two state
troopers were in the front seat, with Mr. Hatfield
sitting between them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get in, Dan,&rdquo; the Cub leader said, as the door
swung open. &ldquo;What happened at the shack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan tersely told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On to Mrs. Jones&rsquo; place,&rdquo; one of the state troopers
declared, shifting gears. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the car swung into the farmyard a few minutes
later, Mrs. Jones met the group at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you got here!&rdquo; she said in relief. &ldquo;That
tramp has been making a frightful fuss in the cellar.
We were afraid he would break down the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troopers decided to accost the man from the
outside exit, rather than subjecting the Cubs to possible
gunfire.</p>
<p>With weapons drawn, the two officers flung wide
the double cellar doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out or we&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo; the order was given.</p>
<p>The Cubs thought the tramp might defy the officers.
However, in a moment he came out of his
dark hole, hands raised.</p>
<p>Officer Peterson snapped a pair of handcuffs over
the man&rsquo;s wrists and marched him into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl Blakemore.&rdquo; The tramp blinked owlishly,
his gaze roving from one face to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been living in a shack near here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sleeping there nights,&rdquo; the man muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re under arrest for stealing money from the
home of Sam Hatfield. Anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; the tramp muttered. Then he suddenly
changed his mind. &ldquo;Yes, I have too!&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll take me to jail, so I may
as well tell you the whole story. Not that you&rsquo;ll
believe me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; the trooper encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I stole the money,&rdquo; the tramp frankly
admitted. &ldquo;The first place I took it from was the
Merrimac house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was telling the truth when he said he&rsquo;d
lost a strongbox!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;The other claimants
were false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Merrimac&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; the tramp confirmed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, except for twenty-five dollars I used
to live on, every cent of it is still here in the
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the box get in the coal bin of the
church?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. But first I&rsquo;d like to tell why
I came to Webster City in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the story in your own way,&rdquo; Trooper Peterson
instructed him. &ldquo;You can put your hands down
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair to warn you that anything you say
may be used against you in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got nothing to hide,&rdquo; the tramp said with a
shrug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a tough life, knockin&rsquo; around the
world. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve had enough to eat&mdash;sometimes
I haven&rsquo;t. For awhile I worked on a lake
freighter. Then I got a bad infection in my leg.
When I came out of the hospital, I was broke and
discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began to turn things over in my mind, wishing
I could settle down and start a new life. Then I
remembered I had an uncle here in Webster City
that was well fixed. I&rsquo;d never paid any attention to
the old duffer, or he to me. I couldn&rsquo;t even remember
his name. But I thought I&rsquo;d drift out this way
and look him up. Figured he might stake me to a
new start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was your uncle?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear in a minute. Well, as I was saying,
I came out here and tried to look him up. I didn&rsquo;t
have any luck. Finally I was down to my last dime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was desperate. I tried to get help from charity,
but was told they couldn&rsquo;t help me because I was a
non-county resident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind all these details,&rdquo; State Trooper
Peterson cut in impatiently. &ldquo;You robbed the Merrimac
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard talk in a pool room that the old man
had a strongbox. I noticed by watching the house
that he was careless about locking his doors. So I
watched my chance and slipped in. I found the box
without any trouble. But as I was leaving, I saw a
photograph that gave me a terrific shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Merrimac&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo; questioned the trooper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was a picture of my mother. In a flash, I
knew that I was robbing my own uncle, because he
was the only person in Webster City who would
have such a photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you went through with the deed all the
same?&rdquo; Officer Peterson reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have time to think things to a conclusion,&rdquo;
the tramp said lamely. &ldquo;As I was looking
at the photograph, a woman came into the house
to do some work. Seeing her, I got panicky and
fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I kept it. But right away, my conscience began
to bother me. I&rsquo;d never stolen anything before.
The last thing I wanted to do was take money from
my own relative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made up my mind I&rsquo;d return it and then try to
get Merrimac to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What changed your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything worked against me. First I made the
mistake of hiding the money box in the empty
church. It was my bad luck that the Cub Scouts
had a meeting there before I had a chance to get it
back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were the man we met on the street that
night in the rain!&rdquo; Dan identified him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I asked you what was going on. That was
the first I knew the church had been reopened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then later you peeked through the church window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a light in the basement first,&rdquo; the tramp
explained. &ldquo;That gave me a real scare. But I had a
worse jolt when I saw you kids had found the
money and were counting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You followed us in a car after we left the
church?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where would I get a car?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you learn where the money box
was taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d either take it home or to the police
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you broke into my home later and took the
box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to get it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dressed as a woman so you wouldn&rsquo;t be
recognized?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield resumed the questioning.
&ldquo;You wore a black silk dress with diamond-shaped
jet buttons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you wore my dress!&rdquo; Mrs. Jones exclaimed
indignantly. &ldquo;Why, then you stole it from
the shed! You&rsquo;ve been taking wood too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time I wrongfully was blaming Jack,&rdquo;
Mrs. Jones said. &ldquo;And the boy never once spoke up
to set me right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After using the dress, I suppose you hid it in
the hollow log in the woods,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the tramp agreed. &ldquo;For a while I
slept in an unoccupied house near here. After
the contractor drove me away, I had to throw
up that shack in the woods. It was pretty cold
at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about the money?&rdquo; Trooper Peterson reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much more to tell. I made up my
mind to return it to Merrimac like I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried. Once I got into the house, but before I
could put the box where I&rsquo;d found it, someone rang
the doorbell. I had to get out fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could have left the money,&rdquo; the trooper
pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; the tramp admitted. &ldquo;I was sort of
rattled. I just crawled out the back window and
beat it as fast as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, you didn&rsquo;t make another attempt to
return the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I used a little to buy
food. Oh, I was weak all right&mdash;I admit it. But it&rsquo;s
the truth I never intended to steal from my own
uncle. I know you won&rsquo;t believe my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, everything you have told us
tallies with the facts as we know them,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
assured him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s my story and it&rsquo;s all there is to it,&rdquo;
the tramp said, making a despairing gesture with his
hands. &ldquo;You may as well take me off to jail now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troopers escorted the man to the waiting car.
As the man left the home, he paused in the doorway
to direct a word to the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hard feelings, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You fellows
made it plenty tough for me, but I&rsquo;m not blaming
anyone except myself. I led a useless life and I got
what&rsquo;s coming to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the car had driven away, Mr. Hatfield told
the Cubs they must return to Webster City without
further delay. So much time had elapsed that he
was afraid lest their parents worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, we owe you a lot,&rdquo; he said, shaking the
boy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Through your cooperation, my name
will be completely cleared, and Mr. Merrimac will
have his money again. Many thanks not only from
me but from all the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; the boy replied in deep embarrassment.
He hesitated, and then with a darting
glance at Mrs. Jones asked: &ldquo;Are you going to send
me back to the Institute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send you back?&rdquo; Mrs. Jones demanded with a
quick laugh which had real affection. &ldquo;Why, Jack!
What an idea! I need you here to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do? You aren&rsquo;t just saying it?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I truly need and want you,&rdquo; the widow repeated.
&ldquo;Since my own sons grew up, I&rsquo;ve wanted
another boy the worst way. One I could depend
on. Shucks! I wouldn&rsquo;t have a boy without
spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never run away again,&rdquo; Jack said earnestly.
&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a Cub gives a promise, he never breaks
it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reminded him. &ldquo;So be sure you
really mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Cub,&rdquo; Jack said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be
one someday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t join the organization
if you&rsquo;re willing to live up to the rules,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield assured him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you a little start
now. Boys, show Jack the Cub sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys all raised the two first fingers of their
right hands, holding them high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Jack asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two fingers signify the ears of the Wolf,&rdquo;
Dan explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Indian sign for &lsquo;intelligence,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
added. &ldquo;If you want to be a Cub, Jack, you
must learn to use your head instead of your emotions.
Remember that the next time you&rsquo;re inclined
to do something rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; Jack grinned, making the sign
with his right hand. &ldquo;From now on, you can depend
on me. I promise!&rdquo;</p>

<br />Knights of the Round Table</h2>
<p>In the Cubs&rsquo; meeting room at the church, parents
had gathered to witness a knighting ceremony of
the entire Pack.</p>
<p>The room had been gaily decorated with colorful
banners made by the boys of Den 2. Chairs had
been arranged in a perfect circle to represent the
Round Table.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening Den 1 already had offered
its ceremonial performance. Now it was time for
Den 2 to show what it could do.</p>
<p>From the ante-room where the Cubs were scrambling
into their suits of armor, a buzz of conversation
issued forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, fellows!&rdquo; Dan urged the others. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
three minutes past starting time now. Everyone all
set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get this flashlight to work,&rdquo; complained
Red. As a torch bearer, he was assigned to hold a
long pole with a flashlight attached to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been playing with it too much,&rdquo; Brad
told him. &ldquo;Luckily, I brought some extra batteries.
Here, put this in, and we&rsquo;ll be ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to forget my lines,&rdquo; Babe mumbled,
repeating them over and over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do fine,&rdquo; Brad encouraged him. &ldquo;All ready,
fellows? Dan, you&rsquo;re to do the knighting honors. So
get in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A trumpet, slightly off-key, blared a triumphal
salute.</p>
<p>Pulling his armor into place, Dan marched into
the ceremonial hall to take his position in front of
a torch bearer. Addressing the onlooking parents,
he said clearly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among us tonight there are a few who have not
yet joined the Knights of the Round Table. Although
these newcomers have no armor of steel, they are
equipped with armor of good will, squareness and
honor. So we are gathered here to welcome them
into our circle. Bring the first man forward!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Brad, holding a torch high, led Jack Phillips from
the sidelines. At a signal, the boy knelt on his left
knee in front of Dan, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a knight of the Cub Scout organization, you
must promise always to do your part. You must follow
our leader, obey his orders and give good will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise always to do my best,&rdquo; slowly repeated
Jack, who had been coached in his lines.</p>
<p>With his wooden sword, Dan tapped the boy
lightly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dub thee a Knight of the Round Table,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;As a knight and member of Den 2, you are expected
to help with all our crusades. Arise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack scrambled up, everyone cheered and
clapped. The ceremony however, was not over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome you, Sir Jack!&rdquo; Dan continued.
&ldquo;Don your armor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suit fashioned from cardboard, burlap and roofing
discs had been prepared for the boy. Babe and
Midge helped him get into the costume.</p>
<p>Then as Jack reappeared all decked out as a
knight, the other boys formed a double column,
facing each other. Swords were raised above their
heads to form a long archway. Jack walked through
to take his place at the end of the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Next, Babe, who was only a Bobcat, received the
Order of the Wolf. Other promotions and achievement
awards were given out.</p>
<p>As a climax to the knighting ceremony, Dan was
promoted from Wolf to Bear rank. The boy had
worked hard to win the honor, learning rules of
safety, making many handicraft articles and learning
how to tie difficult knots.</p>
<p>His most appreciated task however, had been the
making of a fifty-page Den scrapbook.</p>
<p>In the book the boy had included press notices
of Den meetings and activities. Ten of the pages
were devoted to snapshots of the Cubs and to published
accounts concerning the missing money box
and its recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This scrapbook will be one of the Den&rsquo;s most
treasured possessions,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield assured him at
conclusion of the knighting ceremony. &ldquo;It will serve
always as a nice reminder of our little adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the evening was over, the Cubs were to
have another very pleasant surprise. Soon the Cub
Master made the announcement for which everyone
had been waiting. Den 2 had won first prize in the
knighting ceremony, with Brad and Dan being
awarded individual honors for having the most
original suits of armor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>After congratulations were over, Dan thought to
ask Mr. Hatfield if he had heard what was to become
of the tramp, Carl Blakemore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in jail the last I heard,&rdquo; the Cub leader
replied. &ldquo;I was told though that Mr. Merrimac
offered to go his bail. He investigated and found
that the fellow had told the truth about being his
nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer that he didn&rsquo;t know him by sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d never seen him&mdash;not even as a boy,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield explained. &ldquo;It was quite humiliating for
Mr. Merrimac to find out about Carl. However, he&rsquo;s
making the best of a bad situation, and I understand,
wants to help him if he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Mother and her helpers had prepared
a fine supper for all the Cubs. Dan and Mr. Hatfield
were starting toward the table, when at the same
moment they saw a newcomer enter the church
meeting room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Merrimac himself!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.</p>
<p>The elderly man never before had attended a
Cub meeting, and in fact, derived little enjoyment
from social affairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Now his gaze wandered from Cub to Cub until
he had picked out Dan and Brad from the group.
Made aware that he seemed to be looking for them,
they went over to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; he said heartily, &ldquo;I believe I made
you a little promise several days ago. And according
to the code of the Cubs, a promise always must
be kept. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; agreed Brad, smiling broadly. Already
he had a notion as to what had brought Mr. Merrimac
to the Cub meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys did me a big favor,&rdquo; the man continued.
&ldquo;I never expected to see the color of my
money again, but thanks to your fine organization
I got nearly every penny of it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Phillips had a hand in it too,&rdquo; Dan reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fully aware of that,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac nodded.
&ldquo;Fact is, I&rsquo;ve talked to court officials about the lad.
I mean to help him if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a good home with Mrs. Jones,&rdquo; Brad said
hastily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, he likes it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have no intention of taking the boy away
from her. That thought never entered my head. I did
think that later on, the lad may want a little special
schooling that Mrs. Jones may not be able to provide.
That&rsquo;s where I aim to step into the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed, while Dan
echoed the sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get back to the purpose of my call here tonight,&rdquo;
Mr. Merrimac resumed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember I
promised that if my money were recovered I&rsquo;d not
forget the church fund?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we wouldn&rsquo;t hold you to it,&rdquo; Brad said
generously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! I always intended to give to the building
fund. I was a bit testy about it because of my loss.
Well, I can see you&rsquo;re in a hurry to get started on
those victuals, so I&rsquo;ll cut it short. Here&rsquo;s my donation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed Dan a check. The boy read the figure
$1,500.00 and whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! This is more than generous, Mr. Merrimac!
It&rsquo;s magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your contribution will put the Cubs over the
top!&rdquo; added Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I have to say,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac declared.
&ldquo;I have to get back home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay for supper, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo; Dan urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want to be home,&rdquo; the old man replied.
&ldquo;My nephew is there now, you know. Came this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information was new to the boys, but they
tried not to show curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carl will stay with me for a while,&rdquo; Mr. Merrimac
explained. &ldquo;I was able to get him off on probation.
If he leads a straight life, as I think he will, he&rsquo;ll
be assured of a good home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your heart&rsquo;s in the right spot, Mr. Merrimac,&rdquo;
Dan declared warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; the old man chuckled, embarrassed by the
praise. &ldquo;Well, good-bye boys, or should I say, Sir
Knights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A delightful social hour followed for the Cubs,
their parents and friends. Among those present was
Mrs. Jones, who seemed as proud of Jack as if he
were her own son.</p>
<p>All too soon to please the Cubs, it was time for
the meeting to break up. Brad began to put away
the swords and other items used during the ceremony.</p>
<p>Coming upon the scrapbook which Dan had
made, he fingered through it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did a bang-up job recording the history of
the Cubs,&rdquo; he praised. &ldquo;But why all the blank pages
at the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They represent the future,&rdquo; Dan laughed, stepping
out of his armor. &ldquo;And boy! Judging from the
past, what a future we&rsquo;ll have. How about it, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best to make &rsquo;er glow!&rdquo; shouted
Chips.</p>
<p>The other Cubs, gathering up their belongings,
signified agreement, by giving a long and lusty wolf
wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-h-h-kay Iaa!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;W-e-e-l d-o-o-o-o
our Best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that note, the Cubs in a burst of enthusiasm,
grabbed Dan and tossed him a little way into the
air. Then, like a pack of healthy young wolves, they
raced out of the meeting hall.</p>
